					<h1>Banff National Park, Canada</h1>
					<p>If you've wanted to visit the Canadian Rocky Mountains then Banff is definitely the destination for you. It's located in the rockies, west of Calgary in the province of Alberta. The nearest airport is Calgary International Airport and then it's a couple of hours drive to Banff.</p>

					<p>We had a comfortable commute to Banff town on the Brewster Express from downtown Calgary, complete with scenic mountain views. After a fairly long drive, we arrived at our hotel <a target="_blank" href="http://moosehotelandsuites.com/">Moose Hotel and Suites</a>. Moose is one of the nicest hotels I've stayed in and is the newest to Banff town, built in 2016. As expected the hotel, facilities and our suite were in perfect condition. It was luxurious and had a modern kitchenette, balcony and a cosy electric fire. The amenities were excellent too, there's 2 roof-top pools, a spa, onsite restaurant and more.</p>

					<p>I recommend spending some time walking around the cute little resort town of Banff and going on some easy walking trails, you'll be amazed at what you can see just by walking a short distance. The Bow River trail is a nice, easy, picturesque walk and leads to Bow Falls.</p>

					<p>If you're after something a bit more challenging and adventurous, the Tunnel Mountain trail is ideal. The elevation gain is 300 m and the roundtrip from Banff town took about 2.5 hours, mostly because it started snowing half way up. Unfortunately the snow meant we couldn't see amazing views when we got to the top, but the experience was incredible and the trees looked like a dream covered in snow.</p>

					<p>Our trip to Lake Louise was the highlight for me, we booked a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.banfftours.com/">Discover Banff Tour</a> to take us and it was just perfect. It snowed the day before and the snow settled, resulting in a stunning winter wonderland scene. It's  worth nipping into the impressive Fairmont Hotel to defrost and have a nose around this swanky hotel before heading back to the lake. On this tour we also visited the Fairmont Banff Springs Hotel, the Hoodoos, Bow River, Bow Falls, Surprise Corner and made a quick stop by the Vermillion Lakes to take some photos.</p>

					<p>We stayed in Banff for 3 nights in October 2017 and I recommend staying for at least 5 nights to see everything. When I return, I'd like to visit the hot springs, take a ride on the Banff gondola and see Moraine Lake, Lake Minnewanka, Peyto Lake and Jasper National Park.</p>

					<h2>My Top Tips</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Wrap up warm - thermals, layers, waterproofs and comfortable shoes are a must, the temperature dropped to -10°C/14°F one night</li>
						<li>Hiking necessities - don't be like me, pack bottles of water and energy bars... also don't bring a handbag it's a pain to carry!</li>
						<li>No car, no problem - we got around fine without one. There are <a target="_blank" href="https://www.banfftours.com/">tours</a> you can do and <a target="_blank" href="http://roamtransit.com/schedules-routes/banff-local-route-one/">Roam buses</a> that can take you to places for $2 </li>
						<li>So many lakes... so little time - Lake Louise is an absolute must! Make it a priority to visit this beauty otherwise you'll miss out</li>
					</ul>
