					<h1>Carvoeiro, Portugal</h1>
					<p>We flew into Faro Aiport and booked a return journey with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.yellowfishtransfers.com/en/">Yellowfish Transfers</a> to take us to our hotel, where we booked a 4 night stay. It was &euro;87 for the roundtrip and was highly worth it! Yellowfish provided an excellent service, with free WiFi and knowledgeable drivers.</p>

					<p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.minorhotels.com/en/tivoli/tivoli-carvoeiro">Tivoli Carvoeiro</a> is not your average 5-star Hotel, it’s location is just unbeatable; nested up high within the most stunning golden cliffs, with a private sandy beach, surrounded by turquoise and blue ocean waters.</p>

					<p>We were very impressed with the hotel; the simplistic room decor and outstanding service received made it a truly excellent place to stay. Walking into the lobby and looking unimpeded to the sea and the horizon beyond let’s you know you somewhere truly special.</p>

					<p>The grounds are breathtaking and very well maintained so it’s worth exploring the area. There are rough pathways in both surrounding cliffs which you can climb up to see some epic views. The cliff farthest from the pool was our favourite spot to take in the sunset.</p>

					<p>Breakfast was just perfect, it was an impressive spread, some may say a feast! We were treated to fresh fruits, cured meats, cheese, smoked salmon, eggs made to order, hot buffet choices, cereals, pastries, cakes and much more. The waiters were highly attentive, they even remembered our food choices from the previous day and were on hand to provide anything we requested.</p>

					<p>The location of the Tivoli Carvoeiro Hotel is about a 10 minute walk from the town centre. The town is small but lovely, it has restaurants, cafes, local shops and leads to Carvoeiro beach.</p>

					<p>We visited 2 main beaches on our trip. Both were fairly small but nice, gold sandy beaches, surrounded by picturesque cliffs and caves.</p>

					<p>The boardwalk looks like it goes on forever but it’s not bad at all once your on it so don’t be put off by the length of it! It’s a nice, short stroll along the ocean and leads to the town centre by the beach.</p>

					<p>About mid-way through on the boardwalk you’ll notice some stairs tailing off, follow this to find the caves. There are steps cut into the cliffs that are perfectly fine to use but be warned it does look a bit scary and is unsuitable for small children and those wobbly on their feet. Once you get down to the caves, you can have a good wander and you may choose to climb up higher or follow the pathways cut into the rocks. It’s the perfect place to watch the sunset but make sure to get back to the boardwalk before its dark as there are no lights!</p>

					<p>We ate out in the town every day for dinner. Villa Medici was our favourite restaurant, offering delicious Italian cuisine and generous portions. The pizza is excellent, has a thin base and huge! We also ate at Wolf’s which was a nice option with a good menu, I highly recommend the tempura prawns to start with. On our last day we visited Case Algarvia to try some Portuguese dishes. We had the pork and clam Cataplana which was like a cross between a stew and a paella. It was tasty but a bit gritty due to the clams. Drinks were very cheap here, with a glass of wine costing €3.50 so a good option if you’re on budget.</p>

					<p>I recommend a trip to Carvoeiro if you’re in need of a rest or just love to be surrounded by natural beauty. It offers cliffs, caves and scenic oceanic views and is the perfect place to visit in the off-peak season. We visited in December 2017 and the weather was lovely in the day with highs of 18 degrees (pretty hot in the sun) and chilly in the evening. The hotels, town, restaurants and beaches are quiet and peaceful so you can have a truly relaxing experience.</p>

					<h2>My Top Tips</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Venture out - if you get bored in Carvoeiro you may be tempted to visit Portimão... don’t! It’s very rundown and we didn't enjoy it there</li>
						<li>Sunset sky - the caves and boardwalk are definitely the prime spots to watch the sun go down and to get some spectacular pictures</li>
						<li>Watch your step - stairs are carved into the rocks at the caves but some have eroded away, so take care when making your way down!</li>
