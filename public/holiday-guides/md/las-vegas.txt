# The Essential Guide to Las Vegas

This was my second time to Las Vegas and I had a blast celebrating my birthday out there! It's obviously a very popular place for partying, gambling and to watch shows but the theming and restaurants and shopping were my personal highlights.

## Getting to Las Vegas

It's quite a long flight from London to Vegas so make sure you fly with a good airline. We flew with Virgin and were so engrossed in watching films and getting fed every couple of hours that the 10 hour 45 minute flight literally flew by! When we arrived in Vegas we ordered an Uber to take us to the hotel which took 30 minutes and cost $22.

## Where to Stay in Las Vegas

The vast choice of hotels in Vegas can make this decision really difficult. If you are staying on the strip you will be in the heart of of the entertainment and in walking distance to restaurants, bars, shopping centres and show venues. 

We decided to stay at The Venetian for 4 nights and mainly because the price dropped dramatically 2 weeks before we were due to travel.

## Favourite Restaurants/Pubs in Las Vegas

## Black Tap

We ate here twice and food was amazing both times, sadly you can't reserve a table but we didn't have to wait long when we showed up. The real USP of [Black Tap](https://www.venetian.com/restaurants/black-tap.html) are the mammoth 'Crazyshakes' they serve. I was lucky enough to try not one but two shakes; 'The Cake Shake' which was a dream shake topped with a slice of funfetti cake and the 'Cookies â€™N Cream Supreme' which is an aboslute must for Oreo lovers.

## Beauty & Essex, The Cosmopolitan

I celebrated my birthday here and I couldn't have picked a better restaurant. [Beauty & Essex](http://beautyandessex.com/las-vegas/) is super stylish and is the perfect venue for celebrating a special occasion. The menu consists of small dishes which are designed to be shared like tapas, so each dish is fairly small (by US standards!) and are portioned up for a party of 5/6 people. 

Everything on menu looked great, I would have loved to have tried it all but we sensibly picked 7 items to be shared between the 5 of us. Our favourite dishes were the 'Grilled Cheese, Smoked Bacon & Tomato Soup Dumplings' these were absolutely heavenly, 'Croque Monsieur Mac & Cheese' which was rich and perfectly cheesy with a crispy topping and the 'Tuna Poke Wonton Tacos' which disappeared in the blink of an eye. 

The service was also excellent and both myself an John (the birthday people) were treated to a surprise dessert of incredible chocolate cake pops!

## TAO Asian Bistro, The Venetian

[TAO](https://www.venetian.com/restaurants/tao.html) is another fine dining restaurant which is immensely popular for dinner so I highly recommend booking a table. The decor is enchanting from the moment you walk in, there are rose petal baths, luxurious red velvet seats, low lighting with lots of pillar candles and the biggest buddha statue I've ever seen in the centre of the restaurant! 

The menu includes dim sum, sushi, rice and noodles as well as meat, veg and seafood options. We loved the 'Rock Shrimp Lettuce Cups', 'Crispy Coconut Shrimp' and the 'Crispy Thai Pork' in fact every dish we tried here was super delicious so I would 100% recommend having dinner here especially if you plan on going to the club as your entrance is free when you dine here.

## Grand Lux Cafe, The Venetian

By the owners of The Cheesecake Factory, the [Grand Lux Cafe](https://www.venetian.com/restaurants/grand-lux-cafe-venetian.html) was the best place for breakfast - you get massive portions and they know how to make a proper cup of tea! I liked the decor and relaxed atmosphere, it is deceivingly big so it's nice place to relax and refuel. We had an omelette and smoked salmon and eggs and it was lovely accompanied by the hash potatoes on the side.

## Top Tips
* Gold digger - all Vegas hotels charge a resort fee which is not included in the total cost of the room - we paid $50 per night for 2 people!
* Look but don't touch - the mini bar in The Venetian has weight sensors under the products, if you pick something up you may get charged
* Shop 'til you drop - if you like shopping you have to go to the Las Vegas North Premium Outlets which is only a 15 minute drive from the strip
