# My Guide to Las Vegas

This was my second time to Las Vegas and I had a blast celebrating my birthday out there! It's obviously a popular tourist destination for partying, gambling and entertainment but for me my personal highlights were the impressive hotels, incredible choice of restaurants and vast opportunites for shopping.

## Getting to Las Vegas

It's quite a long flight from London to Vegas so make sure you fly with a decent airline. We flew with Virgin and were so engrossed in watching films and getting fed every couple of hours that the 10 hour 45 minute flight literally flew by! When we arrived in Vegas we ordered an Uber to take us to the hotel which took 30 minutes and cost $22.

## Where to Stay in Las Vegas

The choice of hotels in Las Vegas can make this decision really difficult! We stayed in 2 hotels on this trip, the Stratosphere and The Venetian. I hated the Stratosphere - it was old, haggard and just plain grotty! The surrounding area is incredibly rundown too and I just didn't feel safe walking around there at night so I would not recommend staying there... ever.

Ideally you want to stay in the heart of the strip so you're close to the entertainment and in walking distance to restaurants, bars, shopping centres and the main venues. 

After the Stratosphere, we experienced true luxury in a plush king suite at The Venetian hotel which cost £584 for 4 nights. Being a suite, the room was generously sized with a sunken living room, comfy bedroom area and huge, fancy bathroom. One of the things that I liked most about the room was it was super quiet and peaceful so we had the best nights sleep there after busy days roaming around. The Venetian also that had an incredible line up of quality restaurants that I was eager to try so it was perfect being so close.

## Things to Do in Las Vegas &amp; Places to Visit

### Hotels

I highly recommend spending a day walking down the strip to see all the cool hotels. The Bellagio, Caesars Palace, The Cosmopolitan, Paris and of course the Venetian are my top choices to wander around.

### Las Vegas North Premium Outlets

They have excellent [outlet shops](https://www.premiumoutlets.com/outlet/las-vegas-north/stores) which actually have good, affordable deals in the more premium shops. I spent my time wandering in and out of Kate Spade trying to stop myself from purchasing the whole shop as the discounts were just too good to miss!

### Penn & Teller, Rio

We got tickets last minute to see [Penn & Teller](https://www.caesars.com/rio-las-vegas/shows/penn-and-teller) and I have to say their performance exceeded my expectations. It's a really cleaver show that featured some mind boggling tricks, we found it entertaining throughout so it's definitely worth a watch.

## Favourite Restaurants on the Strip in Las Vegas

## Black Tap

We ate here twice and food was amazing both times, sadly you can't reserve a table but we didn't have to wait long when we showed up. The real USP of [Black Tap](https://www.venetian.com/restaurants/black-tap.html) are the mammoth 'Crazyshakes' they serve. I was lucky enough to try not one but two shakes; 'The Cake Shake' which was a dream shake topped with a slice of funfetti cake and the 'Cookies ’N Cream Supreme' which is an absolute must for Oreo lovers.

## Beauty & Essex, The Cosmopolitan

I celebrated my birthday here and I couldn't have picked a better restaurant. [Beauty & Essex](http://beautyandessex.com/las-vegas/) is super stylish and is the perfect venue for celebrating a special occasion. The menu consists of small dishes which are designed to be shared like tapas, so each dish is fairly small (by US standards!) and are portioned up for a party of 5/6 people. 

Everything on menu looked great, I would have loved to have tried it all but we sensibly picked 7 items to be shared between the 5 of us. Our favourite dishes were the 'Grilled Cheese, Smoked Bacon & Tomato Soup Dumplings' these were absolutely heavenly, 'Croque Monsieur Mac & Cheese' which was rich and perfectly cheesy with a crispy topping and the 'Tuna Poke Wonton Tacos' which disappeared in the blink of an eye. 

The service was also excellent and both myself an John (the birthday people) were treated to a surprise dessert of incredible chocolate cake pops!

## TAO Asian Bistro, The Venetian

[TAO](https://www.venetian.com/restaurants/tao.html) is another fine dining restaurant which is immensely popular for dinner so I highly recommend booking a table. The decor is enchanting from the moment you walk in, there are rose petal baths, luxurious red velvet seats, low lighting with lots of pillar candles and the biggest buddha statue I've ever seen in the centre of the restaurant! 

The menu includes dim sum, sushi, rice and noodles as well as meat, veg and seafood options. We loved the 'Rock Shrimp Lettuce Cups', 'Crispy Coconut Shrimp' and the 'Crispy Thai Pork' in fact every dish we tried here was super delicious so I would 100% recommend having dinner here especially if you plan on going to the club as your entrance is free when you dine here.

## Grand Lux Cafe, The Venetian

By the owners of The Cheesecake Factory, the [Grand Lux Cafe](https://www.venetian.com/restaurants/grand-lux-cafe-venetian.html) was the best place for breakfast - you get massive portions and they know how to make a proper cup of tea! I liked the decor and relaxed atmosphere, it is deceivingly big so it's nice place to relax and refuel. We had an omelette and smoked salmon and eggs and it was lovely accompanied by the hash potatoes on the side.

## Top Tips
* Money for nothing - Vegas hotels charge a resort fee in addition to the total cost of the room - we paid $50 per night for 2 people!
* Look but don't touch - the mini bar in The Venetian has weight sensors under the products, if you pick something up you may get charged
* Shop 'til you drop - if you like shopping you visit the Las Vegas North Premium Outlets which is only a 15 minute drive from the strip

## Final Thoughts 
We stayed in Las Vegas for 5 nights in October 2018 and that was the perfect amount of time for us. I really loved my time in Vegas and I think there is much more to this vibrant city than the seedy side that often amplified. It's the prime place to go if you are celebrating a special occasion and even more fun when joined by close friends! When I return I would like to visit [Red Rock Canyon](https://www.redrockcanyonlv.org/), try some cocktails and chocolates at [Rosina](https://www.venetian.com/restaurants/rosina.html) and grab some Southern cuisine at [Yardbird](https://www.venetian.com/restaurants/yardbird.html).
