#  A Guide to Paris, France

The last time I went to Paris was 15 years ago as a teen and this time I got to explore loads more!

We travelled to Paris on the Eurostar from London St. Pancras, which was a super quick journey, only 2 hours 20 minutes to reach Gare Du Nord station, Paris.

We booked a 3 night stay at Monhotel Lounge & Spa which is a boutique hotel located minutes away from the Arc De Triomphe and the Champs Elysee! The hotel is down a quiet side road in a tranquil neighbourhood, so the ideal place to escape the crowds.

The hotels decor is striking, with a monochromatic colour scheme with pops of vibrant red. There are large sparkly chandeliers throughout, quirky lamps, pop art pictures and soft floral touches of white roses and calla lilies. The style is reflected nicely to the generously sized rooms in this gem of a hotel. We were incredibly lucky to stay in an Executive Room which featured an open plan bathroom with a deep soaking bathtub, the biggest rainfall shower head I’ve seen, a king size bed and handy designer toiletries.

Each morning we had the American style buffet breakfast, which consisted of pancakes, crepes, hot food items such as scrambled eggs and sausages, continental selection of meats, cheeses, granola, cereal and more!

Getting around couldn’t be easier, especially coming from London with our complex tube system! You can purchase a Paris Visite Pass which is a travel card that includes access to certain zones for a set duration. We purchased a 3 day pass right at Gare De Nord covering zones 1-3 which cost around €25 per person and we got decent use out of it.

## Things to do and places to see

Central Paris is divided into districts called  arrondissements, so when you look at the areas on your maps app you’ll see the zones clearly marked e.g. 1st Arr.

### Champs-Élysées - 8th Arr.
Like the Oxford Street of Paris, expect this avenue to be very busy with high end shops and a mass of restaurants and bars. 

### Arc De Triomphe - 8th Arr.
An impressive Arc monument with intricate carvings and sculptures, commission by Napoleon in 1806.

For €12 per person you can climb the 284 steps for breath taking views of Paris. Do check the opening times before making your way down as it is as closed for us in February, probably due to the snowy conditions.

### Eiffel Tower
Having seen the [Eiffel Tower](https://www.toureiffel.paris/en) 13 years ago and being able to walk freely around this beautiful structure and surrounding park, I was saddened to see it completely enclosed by metal sheeting. The security has been stepped up massively and they are planning to build a bullet-proof glass wall around it as a safety measurement. I don’t advise visiting it up close until this glass wall is complete because I found it chaotic to manoeuvres around it and get near it because they’ve blocked off most of the walkways.

At dusk when it was lit up, and from afar it still looked spectacular.

### The Lourve Museum
The [Lourve](https://www.louvre.fr/en/) is the world's biggest art museum, famous for its most popular attraction; Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa. Admission was €15 per person and only really worth it if you're into Renaissance art and sculptures. Personally I can't say I was a big fan of the artwork, but I did find the glass, pyramid structure and architecture of this museum interesting. I also appreciated the baroque interior, particularly the ceilings with all the elaborate details.

### Notre Dame Cathedral
Unfortunately we didn't manage to make it inside this historic, gothic building, however [Notre Dame](http://www.notredamedeparis.fr/en/visites/) is still a spectacular sight from the outside, especially at night with all the uplighting.

### Rue Crémieux
The prettiest road with colourful houses! Maybe don’t travel too far out of your way to see this as it’s literally a single street but it’s definitely worth a visit if you can make it.

### Musée D’Orsay
In my opinion the [Musée D’Orsay](http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/home.html) is better than The Lourve, mainly because I like Impressionism art and they had Van Gogh and Monet exhibitions! 

Also if you venture up to the fifth floor on the opposite side to the massive antique clock, you can get a great view of the city.

## Pont des Arts
We actually just stumbled upon this bridge on our way from Musée D’Orsay to grab some lunch. It’s warming to see all of the locks and messages of love on them!
