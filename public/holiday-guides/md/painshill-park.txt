# Painshill Park Cobham

Painshill Park is a huge park/garden in Surrey which has many impressive monuments to discover, these include the famous Painshill crystal grotto, a vineyard where they produce sparkling wine, vast woodlands to explore and a Gothic Temple which has the best views of the park! 

As the gardens are so picturesque it's the ideal place to have a picnic when the weather is nice or treat yourself to something in the tea room, handy if you're visiting in autumn/winter and need some shelter!

## Getting to Painshill Park<a name="getting-there"></a>

We drove to [Painshill Park](https://www.painshill.co.uk/contact-us/) which is located in Cobham. They have a big car park and parking is also free which is a bonus.

## Things to See at Painshill Park<a name="things-to-see"></a>

## Gothic Temple
The Gothic Temple was the highlight for me, not only is it pretty but it's boasts some incredible views!

## Painshill Park Grotto
I don't know why but I originally thought the crystal grotto was all natural but it's obviously not! It's really lovely to see in person, especially if you like sparkly, I mean who's not interested in being inside crystal caves?! This was the busiest place in the whole park but it's certainly not overcrowded by any means.

## Fivearch Bridge
This is a cute bridge with the most beautiful backdrop.

## Temple of Bacchus
The temple photographed incredibly well but it was one of the least impressive things I saw at Painshill.

## The Ruined Abbey
This was the last monument we made it to and it was definitely worth seeing but I must admit I was getting quite tired after walking almost 10k steps!

## Painshill Park Opening Times<a name="hours"></a>

It can take a few hours to make your way around the entire park so don't underestimate the time you'll need there or the amount of walking required. The park is open everyday from 10am - 4pm but don't get there too late because they stop letting people in at 3pm.
