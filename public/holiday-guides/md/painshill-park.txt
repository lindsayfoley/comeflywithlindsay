## Getting to Painshill Park<a name="getting-there"></a>
We drove to [Painshill Park](https://www.painshill.co.uk/contact-us/) which is located in Cobham, Surrey. There's a large car park which is free to use but can get quite busy so get there nice and early to avoid any parking hassle!

## Top 5 Things to See at Painshill Park<a name="things-to-see"></a>

I don't want to spoil all your fun so I'll take you through some of my personal highlights, but do note there are other beautiful garden buildings and follies to see which I haven't mentioned below.

## 1. Gothic Temple
The Gothic Temple was the highlight for me, not only is it a pretty structure but it's boasts some incredible views - you're going to want to do a full photoshoot here! The inside is charming with Gothic architecture as you'd expect, pops of red and orange details and cute little windows.

## 2. Painshill Park Grotto
I don't know why but I originally thought the [crystal grotto](https://www.painshill.co.uk/crystal-grotto/) was all natural LOL but it's obviously not! It's really lovely to see in person, especially if you like sparkly things, I mean who's not interested in wandering around crystal caves?! The grotto has it's own [opening hours](https://www.painshill.co.uk/crystal-grotto/) so check times ahead of visiting, it was also the busiest place in the park but certainly not overcrowded by any means.

## 3. Fivearch Bridge
There are a few brides surrounding the lake but I found Fivearch Bridge to be the most attractive as its completely nestled in nature.

## 4. Temple of Bacchus
The Temple of Bacchus was also fairly busy with visitors and as you can see it's impressive from the outside and photographs very well but you couldn't go inside. It's currently undergoing renovation to be restored in the inside so that means another trip for me!

## 5. The Ruined Abbey
This was the last monument we visited and it was the perfect way to end a lovely day full of artistic sights! The Ruined Abbey looks excellent from both the outside and inside.
