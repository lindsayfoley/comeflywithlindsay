# The Cotswolds Travel Guide, England

The Cotswolds is the ideal destination for a quick weekend getaway! It's a massive area covering 5 counties, so you'll need a car to get around to see the sights and explore the little villages. Expect to see the most picturesque towns, historic buildings, peaceful country settings, complete with royal manors and plenty of wildlife.

## Getting to the Cotswolds

We drove to Gloucestershire from South London which took about 2 hours and 45 minutes. I really recommend driving because a lot of the tourist attractions are widely spread across the counties so you can cover much more ground in the car!

## Where to Stay in the Cotswolds

We stayed at the Cotswold House Hotel & Spa in Chipping Campden and found this was the ideal base for exploring the Cotswolds. I really loved this hotel, everything seemed to be perfectly in sync, the staff were pleasant and very professional, the country home decor was spot on and all the dishes we tried were presented immaculately and tasted sensational.

The cottage was super cosy and spacious, it had a very king comfy bed with separate seating area which looked out onto a lovely private garden and to my surprise a hot tub! It was tastefully decorated throughout and had a luxurious bathroom with tub and shower stocked with a fab selection of Orla Kiely toiletries. One of my favourite things about staying here was the nice little touches, we had delicious cookies left in the room each day, there was a handy turndown service in the evenings and the tea set in the rooms were proper tea sets with complimentary milk in the fridge and even bottled water!

## Things to Do in the Cotswolds &amp; Places to Visit

We visited a few of the most popular charming villages in the Cotswolds, they all looked like quintessential English towns that you would see in the movies and all had a good selection of restaurants, cafes and pubs - so highly worth wandering around for a few hours.    

### Chipping Campden

We stayed in Chipping Campden and I have to the location was unrivalled. It's a beautiful, tiny town with sandy coloured, traditional buildings, there was a collection of hotels, restaurants and pubs, but most importantly to me, it wasn't overcrowded in the slightest!

### Bourton-on-the-Water

This town is really cute and famous for it's canals, but boy was it crammed full of tourists! There were literally coach loads of tourists everywhere and I found this made such a small town very hectic. We did go to Bourton-on-the-Water on a Saturday afternoon, but I didn't expect it to be so busy especially when it was raining! I would be worried if I stayed here over night that it would be a massive pain trying to find somewhere to go for dinner due to the overcrowding.

### Stow-on-the-Wold

I liked Stow-on-the-Wold, we drove over from Bourton-on-the-Water in about 10 minutes.
