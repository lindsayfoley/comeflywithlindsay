# The Cotswolds Travel Guide, England

The Cotswolds is an ideal destination for a weekend getaway! But what are they? It's a huge area in England containing the Cotswold Hills, spanning 5 English counties, so you'll need a car to get around to see the sights and explore the little villages! Expect to see the most picturesque towns, historic buildings, peaceful country settings, all complete with royal manors and plenty of wildlife.

## Getting to the Cotswolds

We drove to Chipping Campden in Gloucestershire from South London which took about 2 hours and 45 minutes. I recommend driving because a lot of the tourist attractions are widely spread across the counties so you can cover much more ground by car. Driving was also handy in the rainy/windy weather, I was very pleased we managed to avoid traipsing around in the drizzle and mud! 

It was simple to get around in the Cotswolds, the roads are pretty empty and the surrounding countryside views are a treat! We drove to the nearby Broadway Tower, Sudeley Castle, recommend villages and stopped at Blenheim Castle on our way back to London.

## Where to Stay in the Cotswolds

We stayed at [Cotswold House Hotel & Spa](http://www.cotswoldhouse.com) in Chipping Campden and found this was the ideal base for exploring the Cotswolds. I loved this hotel, everything seemed to be perfectly in sync, the staff were pleasant and very professional, the contemporary decor was warm and inviting, the gardens were certainly beautiful and all the dishes we tried were presented immaculately and tasted delicious.

The cottage was super cosy and spacious, it had a very king comfy bed with separate seating area which looked out onto a lovely private garden and to my surprise a hot tub! It was tastefully decorated throughout and had a luxurious bathroom with tub and shower stocked with a fab selection of Orla Kiely toiletries. One of my favourite things about staying here was the nice little touches, we had homemade cookies left in the room each day, there was a handy turndown service in the evenings and the tea set in the rooms were proper tea sets with complimentary milk in the fridge and even bottled water!

## Things to Do in the Cotswolds &amp; Places to Visit

We visited a few of the most popular, charming villages in the Cotswolds, they all looked like quintessential English towns that you would see in the movies and all had a reasonable selection of restaurants, cafes and pubs - so highly worth seeing.    

### Chipping Campden

We stayed in Chipping Campden and I have to say the location was unrivalled, it's an attractive, tiny town full of sandy-coloured, traditional buildings. There's a collection of hotels, restaurants and cute looking country pubs to keep you busy, and most importantly it's not overcrowded in the slightest! There are some very interesting, old structures here like the Market Hall, [St James Church](http://www.stjameschurchcampden.co.uk/welcome.htm) and the Alms Houses, these are all steps away so you can fully explore the town in no time.

### Bourton-on-the-Water

This village was crammed with tourists but I can see why it's one of most popular places to visit! The main feature is the river that flows through the centre of the town, there are small bridges to cross the canals, quaint buildings and many dining options including tea rooms, cafes and pubs. Popular attractions include [Birdland Park and Gardens](https://www.birdland.co.uk), the [Model Village](http://www.themodelvillage.com) and [Cotswold Motoring Museum](http://www.cotswoldmotoringmuseum.co.uk/).

### Stow-on-the-Wold

We drove to Stow-on-the-Wold from Bourton-on-the-Water in about 10 minutes. I liked stow, unlike the other 2 towns there were some cool looking independent boutiques, a range of bistros, tea rooms, as well as the usual pubs and winding streets to check out. It was great to walk around and you could clearly see that each town has its own identity and something new to offer.

### Blenheim Palace

[Blenheim Palace](https://www.blenheimpalace.com) is an enormous country house located in in Oxfordshire and is perfect to visit on your way to or from London. Tickets to the [palace and the gardens](](https://www.blenheimpalace.com/book/)) are quite steep at £26 per person, but there is a lot to see, we easily spent a good few hours looking at the exhibitions and walking around the massive grounds and gardens. It's easy to see why the location has appeared in so many box office [films]((https://www.blenheimpalace.com/estate/filming-location/)), like Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation and even Bond was here in SPECTRE! 

The palace is the birth place of Winston Churchill and there is a small, permanent [exhibition](https://www.blenheimpalace.com/whats-on/tours/churchill-exhibition.html) dedicated to him, I recommend touring the state rooms and roaming around the gardens if the weather is nice. There is appeal here for all interests, it's well maintained and the exterior is stunning, the are various rooms to discover, which feature elaborate baroque decor, gilded ceilings and lots of artwork.

### Sudeley Castle & Gardens 

[Sudeley Castle](https://www.sudeleycastle.co.uk) is located near Winchcombe and entry is reasonably priced at £16.50 per adult. I wasn't massively blown away by the interiors or exhibits at the castle, it wasn't grand like [Blenheim Palace](https://www.blenheimpalace.com) and could really do with a bit of maintenance in some areas. 

The exterior of the castle, the gardens and the Pheasantry are the best bits. In the Pheasantry you'll see the most amazing collection of exotic pheasants with weird and wonderful coloured features, a lot of them reminded me of Kevin the bird from UP! We were also lucky to see a Peacock and he was even Peacocking for attention! The best time to visit Sudeley Castle would be in spring and summer when the gardens are in full bloom.

### Broadway Tower

[Broadway Tower](https://broadwaytower.co.uk/) looks really cool from the outside, it's pretty striking and surrounded by greenery in every direction you look. You can enter the tower for £5 per adult, and you are able to walk up the narrow, winding stairs to the very top and experience panoramic views. It's not the most interesting place when you are inside if I'm being honest, but it's cheap so you might as well give it a go!

## Favourite Restaurants/Bars in the Cotswolds

## Eight Bells Inn

We had drinks and a yummy dinner at [Eight Bells Inn](http://www.eightbellsinn.co.uk/), it's a welcoming, cosy pub located right near the Alms Houses and St. James' Church so the location is excellent. The pub is quite small and cosy, with exposed brick walls, beamed ceilings and soft lighting. We had a three course meal here and the food was really delicious, it's a great setting to have a relaxed meal and to my delight it didn't get too overcrowded - not even on a Saturday night!

## Fig

We just had to eat at [Fig](http://www.bespokehotels.com/cotswoldhouse/pages/dining), it's the fine dining option located inside [Cotswold House Hotel & Spa](http://www.cotswoldhouse.com) where we were staying. We indulged in the tasting menu priced at £65 per person, and it was truly outstanding. The presentation of the restaurant and the service were pristine, every dish that was planted in front of us looked like a piece of art and tasted amazing. My favourites were the scallops, duck and chocolate desert. If you're looking for a place to have a special meal, I cannot recommend this place enough!

## Top Tips
* From A to B - I recommend driving to travel around comfortably in the Cotswolds because it spans a whopping 800 square miles!
* To book or not to book - BOOK restaurants in advance if staying in Bourton-on-the-Water or Stow-on-the-Wold as these places get busy
* Plan ahead - dedicate some time to plan the things you are going to do and see to ensure you are able to fit it all in

## Final Thoughts 
We stayed in the Cotswolds for 2 nights in April 2018 and I could have easily stayed another couple of nights! When I return I'd like to stop off at Cheltenham, visit the [Daylesford Farm](https://daylesford.com/locations/kingham-gloucestershire/), dine at the [Wild Rabbit](https://thewildrabbit.co.uk/) and see [Gloucestershire Cathedral](http://www.gloucestercathedral.org.uk/visit/plan-your-visit/)
