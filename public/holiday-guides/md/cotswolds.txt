# The Cotswolds Travel Guide, England

The Cotswolds is an ideal destination for a weekend getaway! But what are they? It's a huge area in England containing the Cotswold Hills, spanning 5 English counties, so you'll need a car to get around to see the sights and explore the little villages! Expect to see the most picturesque towns, historic buildings, peaceful country settings, all complete with royal manors and plenty of wildlife.

## Getting to the Cotswolds

We drove to Chipping Campden in Gloucestershire from South London which took about 2 hours and 45 minutes. I recommend driving because a lot of the tourist attractions are widely spread across the counties so you can cover much more ground by car. Driving was also handy in the rainy/windy weather, I was very pleased we managed to avoid traipsing around in the drizzle and mud! 

It was simple to get around in the Cotswolds, the roads are pretty empty and the surrounding countryside views are a treat! We drove to the nearby Broadway Tower, Sudeley Castle, recommend villages and stopped at Blenheim Castle on our way back to London.

## Where to Stay in the Cotswolds

We stayed at [Cotswold House Hotel & Spa](http://www.cotswoldhouse.com) in Chipping Campden and found this was the ideal base for exploring the Cotswolds. I loved this hotel, everything seemed to be perfectly in sync, the staff were pleasant and very professional, the contemporary decor was warm and inviting, the gardens were truly beautiful and all the dishes we tried were presented immaculately and tasted delicious.

The cottage was super cosy and spacious, it had a very king comfy bed with separate seating area which looked out onto a lovely private garden and to my surprise a hot tub! It was tastefully decorated throughout and had a luxurious bathroom with tub and shower stocked with a fab selection of Orla Kiely toiletries. One of my favourite things about staying here was the nice little touches, we had homemade cookies left in the room each day, there was a handy turndown service in the evenings and the tea set in the rooms were proper tea sets with complimentary milk in the fridge and even bottled water!

## Things to Do in the Cotswolds &amp; Places to Visit

We visited a few of the most popular, charming villages in the Cotswolds, they all looked like quintessential English towns that you would see in the movies and all had a reasonable selection of restaurants, cafes and pubs - so highly worth seeing.    

### Chipping Campden

We stayed in Chipping Campden and I have to say the location was unrivalled, it's an attractive, tiny town full of sandy-coloured, traditional buildings. There's a collection of hotels, restaurants and cute looking country pubs to keep you busy, and most importantly it's not overcrowded in the slightest! There are some really interesting, old structures here like the Market Hall, [St James Church](http://www.stjameschurchcampden.co.uk/welcome.htm) and the Alms Houses, these are all steps away so you can fully explore the town in no time.

### Bourton-on-the-Water

This town was crammed with tourists but I can see why it's one of most popular places to visit! The main feature is the river that flows through the centre of the town, there are small bridges to cross the canals, quaint buildings and many dining options including tea rooms, cafes and pubs. Popular attractions include [Birdland Park and Gardens](https://www.birdland.co.uk), the [Model Village](http://www.themodelvillage.com) and [Cotswold Motoring Museum](http://www.cotswoldmotoringmuseum.co.uk/).

### Stow-on-the-Wold

We drove to Stow-on-the-Wold from Bourton-on-the-Water in about 10 minutes. I liked stow, unlike the other 2 towns there were some cool looking independent boutiques, a range of bistros, tea rooms, as well as the usual pubs and winding streets to check out. It was great to walk around and you could really see that each town has its own identity and something new to offer.
