# A Guide to The New Forest

The New Forest is a tranquil place with acres of lush woodland, a plethora of wildlife and even beautiful coastal towns! What made this a truly unique place for me, was seeing ponies and cows roam free, enjoying the forest to the fullest.

I also liked that I didn't have to travel far to spot ponies and cattle as they were out and about, constantly grazing and architecting the forest one bite at a time!

## Getting to New Forest
The New Forest spans an enormous 90 acres so I'd recommend driving if you plan to do a lot of sightseeing. We drove from Surrey to Brook which took about 2.5 hours. If travelling from London, you can catch a train from Waterloo to 9 stations serving the area but it's quite a long journey at 4+ hours!

## Where to Stay in the New Forest
We stayed at [The Bell Inn](https://www.bellinn-newforest.co.uk) which was located in a town called Brook, about 10mins drive from Lyndhurst. Not only is the The Bell Inn a charming hotel, it's also a country pub that serves pub staples and fine food, and even has a golf club to the rear of the property!

We were given a beautiful, spacious [Manor Room](https://www.bellinn-newforest.co.uk/rooms/manor-rooms/) adjacent to the golf club and just a short walk from the main building. The enchanted forest-themed decor gave the room a really welcoming, snuggly feel and reinforced the rural surrounds of the New Forest. Our room also had waffle bathrobes for us to use a nice selection of Bramley toiletries.

After a peaceful nights sleep, the chefs cooked up a great breakfast of smoked salmon and scrambled eggs and a full English breakfast which set us up for the day.

## Travelling around the New Forest

If you don't have a car you can still get around no problem, we purchased a 2-day ticket for the [New Forest Tour](http://www.thenewforesttour.info/) bus which cost £23pp and gave us a well needed break from driving! This is an open-top bus which allows you to hop on and hop off at your leisure, covering the whole of the New Forest over 3 routes. 

We caught the [red route](http://www.thenewforesttour.info/red-route) bus from outside the Green Dragon pub, just a 1 minute walk from The Bell Inn which was super handy. The best place to sit has to be the top deck, but word of warning it can get VERY windy and chilly so make sure your hair is tied up and you bring a jacket, even in summer!

We took the [red route](http://www.thenewforesttour.info/red-route) to the [New Forest Wildlife Park](https://newforestwildlifepark.co.uk/) and the [blue route](http://www.thenewforesttour.info/blue-route) to Barton-on-Sea beach.

## Things to Do in the New Forest &amp; Places to Visit

### Bolderwood Deer Sanctuary 
The scenery on the drive to [Bolderwood Deer Sanctuary](https://www.thenewforest.co.uk/things-to-do/bolderwood-deer-sanctuary-p789391) via Rhinefield Ornamental Drive was just remarkable; think thick woodland with huge redwood trees and a lot of ponies!

[Bolderwood Deer Sanctuary](https://www.new-forest-national-park.com/bolderwood-deer-sanctuary.html) is a peaceful park with walking trails and a dedicated platform for viewing deer. Time your visit during feeding times (between 12-3pm) to increase your chances of spotting some deer!

There's also an area for barbecues, tables for picnics, an information centre, free car park, etc. so you can easily spend a few hours here, especially when the weather is decent.

### Commoner Tom’s New Forest Walks - £65pp
We booked the New Forest walk through The Bell Inn which was hosted by the super knowledgeable [Tom Hoardle](https://www.bellinn-newforest.co.uk/blog/events/commoner-toms-new-forest-walks/) near his farm in Ringwoood. We were up for doing something a bit different to learn about the forest and wanted to find out why exactly animals were allowed to roam wherever they pleased!

![Tom Hoardle's cattle hanging out in the forest](../images/new-forest/tom-hoardles-cattle-new-forest.jpg)

On the morning of the walk, in true British style the weather turned wet and windy! A bit unsure of what to expect we thought this could affect our walk, but it didn't impact it in the slightest as we had the best time.

The talk was excellent, I learnt what commoning was all about and how this type of farming not only cultivates the New Forest land but also paves the way for great biodiversity, giving rare plant life and insects the ideal environment to thrive in. Tom also talks about hand rearing his cattle and provides insight into the practices he undertakes to ensure his animals have longer, happier lives, ultimately affecting the quality of the meat produced.

After the walk we were treated to the most delicious two course meal back at The Bell Inn and had the opportunity to try Tom's produce in a spectacular beef and ale pie made by [chef Mark Young](https://www.bellinn-newforest.co.uk/eat/meet-the-chef/). 

![Just look at that beef and ale pie](../images/new-forest/beef-and-ale-pie-bell-inn-new-forest.jpg)

In addition to the walk, talk and two course meal, transportation is also provided from The Bell Inn to Tom's farm and back, all covered in the cost of the experience making the package well worth it. If you are looking to discover more about the forest from experts who truly care about it, I cannot recommend this enough!

### Barton-on-Sea 

We hopped off the tour bus at Barton-on-Sea and decided to grab a quick lunch at the nearby Beachcomber Cafe. I quite liked this beach, it's a pebble beach with bright beach huts and beautiful views of the Isle of Wight in the distance

![Bright coloured beach huts in Barton-on-Sea](../images/new-forest/barton-on-sea-beach.jpg)
<figcaption>Bright coloured beach huts in Barton-on-Sea</figcaption>

We then started our mammoth walk along the cliff top from Barton-on-Sea to Milford-on-Sea. The walk is fairly easy as it's mostly flat and we saw so much exquisite scenery on the way!

### New Forest Wildlife Park - 12.50pp

It was ok for an hour or two but in my opinion it could benefit from some updating! 

It's quite expensive for what you get as the park is pretty small so only took us about 30 minutes to walk around it. 

---

## Top Tips
* Don't disturb the wildlife - it's not a petting zoo!
* Early bird catches the worm - get the tour bus early as it stops at around 6pm.
* Uber doesn't operate everywhere in the New Forest

## Final Thoughts 

You need to stay a minimum of three nights if you want to fully explore the New Forest.

Next time I'd like to stop in at The Royal Oak in Fritham.
