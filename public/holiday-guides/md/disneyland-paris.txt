# Disneyland Paris Ultimate Holiday Guide

I was incredibly lucky to work for Disney for 4.5 years and in that time I had the opportunity to visit Disneyland Paris a few times. If you've been to Walt Disney World in Florida, you been to the best theme park on this earth! Disneyland Paris is much smaller than World, with just 2 parks and 7 on-site Disney properties so you only really need a few days here to experience it all.

## Getting to the Disneyland Paris

If you are travelling from London then the Eurostar is a must as it only takes 2 hours and 45 minutes to get from St Pancras International to Disneyland Paris (Marne-la-Vallée). When I book my trips to Disneyland Paris, I always, always check Eurostar prices first because it can fluctuate a lot, especially if you want a direct train! If you book far enough in advance and don't mind travelling in-direct, you can get a roundtrip for about £76 per person.

## Where to Stay in Disneyland Paris

I highly recommend staying on-site if this is in budget as it really heightens the experience and gives you the freedom to come and go to the parks as you please. All on-site properties are within walking distance to the parks and Disney Village so you can't be beaten on location. 

If you are on budget I recommend staying at the super cosy [Sequoia Lodge](http://www.disneyholidays.co.uk/disneyland-paris/disney-hotels/disneys-sequoia-lodge/) hotel which is woodland themed and has the snuggliest bar with a large roaring fire! [Disney's Sequoia Lodge](http://www.disneyholidays.co.uk/disneyland-paris/disney-hotels/disneys-sequoia-lodge/) is about a 10 minute walk to both parks and has a restaurant, bar and shop.

If you can spend a bit more then the New England themed Disney's [Newport Bay Club](http://www.disneyholidays.co.uk/disneyland-paris/disney-hotels/disneys-newport-bay-club/) is the one for you. If you've stayed at Walt Disney World before, the decor and theming of Newport Bay is similar to Disney's Yacht and Beach Club and Boardwalk Inn. The hotel was refurbished in 2016 so it's in really great shape and even went up a star rating! Newport Bay](http://www.disneyholidays.co.uk/disneyland-paris/disney-hotels/disneys-newport-bay-club/) is a nice scenic, 15 minute walk away from the parks.

## Things to Do in Disneyland Paris

---

### Disneyland Park

Disneyland Park is just the prettiest park, you know it's special from the moment you enter the park and you see the beautiful Main Street ahead of you with Cinderella's castle in the distance.

### Walt Disney Studios

This park was undergoing renovations when I visited (February 2019) so not a lot of rides to go on.


### Disney Village

There are plenty of shops and a good selection of restaurants in the village. Stop by [King Ludwig’s Castle](https://www.disneylandparis.com/en-gb/dining/disney-village/king-ludwigs-castle/) for a medieval brew.

## Favourite Restaurants in Disneyland Paris

### Inventions
I absolutely love [Inventions](https://www.disneylandparis.com/en-gb/dining/disneyland-hotel/inventions/)! It's located in the Disneyland Hotel so it's very pricey, but well worth it in my opinion. 

### Bistrot Chez Rémy
[Bistrot Chez Rémy](https://www.disneylandparis.com/en-gb/dining/walt-disney-studios-park/bistrot-chez-remy/) is my favourite restaurant in Walt Disney Studios park.

###  Captain Jack's - Restaurant des Pirates 
For me [Captain Jack's](https://www.disneylandparis.com/en-gb/dining/disneyland-park/captain-jacks-restaurant-pirates/) was a real treat, it actually felt like I was dining in the Caribbean! 

### Restaurant Agrabah Café 

[Restaurant Agrabah Café](https://www.disneylandparis.com/en-gb/dining/disneyland-park/agrabah-cafe/) is another buffet, but serving Middle Eastern delights.
