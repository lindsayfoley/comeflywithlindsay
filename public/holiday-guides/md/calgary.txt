# Travelling to Calgary, Canada

There's not a whole lot to do in Downtown Calgary, it seems to be more of a town that people pass through on their way to visit [Banff](banff) to see the Canadian Rocky mountains. I've put together a concise guide on what to do if you're there for a day or two.

## Where to Stay

We stayed at the [Fairmont Palliser Hotel](http://www.fairmont.com/palliser-calgary/) as the room price was incredibly reasonable for such a luxury hotel chain! The location is ideal, as it's in the heart of the city and just a few minutes walk from the Calgary Tower which you can probably see from your hotel room window. This hotel is grand, boasting a lavish foyer with elegant chandeliers, striking marble pillars and rich gold accents.

Our room was generous in size, especially for a standard, and to my delight it was recently refurbished. It was pretty quiet so we slept fairly well, apart from hearing the odd few trains passing through. We ordered room service a few times when suffering from jet-lag and I have to say the the food was consistently outstanding, it was pricey but well worth it! The facilities include an indoor pool, spa and a Starbucks located on the lower ground floor which was useful for water, snacks and of course hot drinks to warm us up.

## Things to Do &amp; Places to See				
				
We walked down to the [Olympic Plaza](http://www.calgary.ca/CSPS/Parks/Pages/Locations/Downtown-parks/Olympic-Plaza.aspx) on Stephen Avenue, where medals were presented in the 1988 Winter Olympics. There were no events on when we visited, but it was still a nice place for a stroll on a sunny day. The plaza is well maintained and has a water feature in the center with the Canadian Maple leaf, surrounded by fountains. Worth a pit-stop, but don't go out of your way to visit.

We went to [Calgary Tower](http://www.calgarytower.com/) one evening for dinner and to checkout the 360-degree views of the city from the observation deck. We chose to eat at the revolving restaurant, [Sky 360](http://www.sky360.ca/) which was definitely a unique dining experience with pleasant food and excellent service. Top tip... don't leave your handbag on the window ledge, I learned the hard way that this doesn't rotate with you!

If you fancy going shopping, catch an Uber for &dollar;15 to the [Chinook Centre](https://www.cfshops.com/chinook-centre.html) which is a 15 minute drive south. It's a large shopping centre with a vast selection of fashion, beauty and homeware stores including a Nordstrom, a food court, cinema and bowling alley.

## My Top Tips
* Dinner with a difference - if you're thinking of booking [Sky 360](http://www.sky360.ca/) for dinner, time your reservation at sunset for a spectacular view
* Wrap up warm - it was snowing in early October and was bitterly cold! Coats, scarves, gloves, hats are a must
* Time well spent - if you're heading to Banff, consider extending your stay to spend more time there and less time in Calgary

## Final Thoughts 

We stayed in Calgary for 2 nights in October 2017, over the Canadian Thanksgiving period (second Monday in October) which may be the reason why it was tremendously quiet. That said, I wouldn't plan to stay here for an extended period of time, a weekend is fine!
