# A Travel Guide to Croatia

We were lucky enough to be invited to a family wedding in Hvar Croatia last year, so made the most of our 7 night trip by seeing as much as we could in the beautiful region of Dalmatia.

## Getting to Split, Croatia

We flew with Croatia Airlines from London to Split which took 2 hours and 25 minutes. As we were landing a bit late at 7.45pm, I pre-arranged a transfer through our first hotel [Balatura Split Luxury Rooms](https://www.balaturasplit.com/) for Â£35 one-way which we were extra glad for as our flight ended up being delayed! Apparently the locals prefer not to fly with Croatia Airlines because they have a reputation for delays so it may be worth checking flights with another airline if you can.

## Where to Stay in the Split

There are tons of hotels in Split, if you stay near Diocletian's Palace in the old town you'll be in a prime spot.  

[Balatura Split Luxury Rooms](https://www.balaturasplit.com/) was situated in a good location, just a quick walk from the Palace but far enough from the bustle so we didn't have issues with noise. The staff were very welcoming and friendly which was just what we needed being first-timers in Croatia. 

Our Deluxe double room was modern, clean and very spacious - it was actually the biggest room out of the 4 Croatian hotels we stayed in and was also where we had the most peaceful nights sleep. In the morning we were treated to a nice continental breakfast buffet in the front patio.

## Things to Do in the Split &amp; Places to Visit

Split looks like a postcard, especially when you get up high enough to admire the landscape! The buildings look very traditional and have terracotta coloured roofs, you're also surrounded by amazing ocean views, mountains and pine forests so it's a real treat for the eyes.

### Diocletian's Palace
[Diocletian's Palace](http://www.diocletianspalace.org/) reminded me of Rome; it's a huge, historic square with little alleyways full of shops, bars, restaurants, hotels, apartments and of course the palace, encased in historic ruins. It's the main attraction in Split so can get incredibly busy, so much so that you can struggle to make your way around it comfortably, so you may want to avoid it during peak times.

### Marjan Park
This was a highlight for me, it involved a lot of walking and the most steps I've seen in my life but it's well worth it for the spectacular sights. It was a 4.5 mile roundtrip walk (at a slow-ish pace) from our hotel to the top of Marjan Park via Diocletian's Palace and we saw some breathtaking panoramic views where I'm sure I took hundreds of photos! When you are about a third of the way in, you are shaded by the pine trees so it's not a bad walk to do on a sunny day, there are also water fountains on the way up and you pass by various sights like the Church of St. Nicholas so you can take breaks little and often. There are various paths you can take to reach the lookout point, if you follow the large Croatian flag that you see in the distance you'll eventually make it up there!

The Catamaran made travelling around the islands of Croatia very simple so island hopping is a must do, especially if you are unable to sit still like me!

### Hvar Island, Croatia

The family wedding we were attending was in Hvar, so that was the next stop on our trip. Hvar looks dreamy when the catamaran pulls in, it's like a postcard and very inviting - you instantly know it's going to be good before you even get off the catamaran! 

We stayed at the [Amfora hotel](https://www.suncanihvar.com/amfora-hvar-grand-beach-resort.html) which was a massive resort hotel, in fact it's the largest hotel on the island and has an impressive, cascading pool at the front of the property. Our room here was on the smaller side but it was very sleek, up to date and fine for us as we didn't spend much time in it. 

You have the lively part of town at one end of the island near the harbour which has a variety of restaurants, bars, shops and St. Stephen's Cathedral. At the other end, there are loads of little beaches with crystal-clear waters which look perfect for swimming but be mindful that the waters have large rocks in areas so check before jumping in!

### Bol in Brac, Croatia
We travelled to Bol for one night after Hvar, I think a day trip is all that's needed as there wasn't a whole lot to do - but this could be down to visiting straight from Hvar which was much more vibrant!

The port is nice, both quaint and quiet with some nice spots to sit and enjoy the views with a drink before heading to your hotel.

The main attraction in Bol is [Zlatni Rat](https://www.visitbrac.com/destinations/bol/zlatni-rat) (what a name!) beach which can be very busy with tourists, so I recommend going there in the late afternoon. Known as the 'Golden Horn', the most photographed part of the beach is shaped into a point around the beautiful clear waters of the Adriatic Sea. It's a pebble beach, but has very fine pebbles so nothing like Brighton beach in the UK! The sea was lovely and warm in August, a little bit choppy in the evening but it was ideal for a swim.

### Trogir
After Brac we went onto Trogir for one night, which was pretty but very small! Trogir island is like a miniature Split set within medieval walls, accessed by bridges to the mainland. There are lots of little alleys on the island which have restaurants, gelato stalls, art and market type shops so it's perfect for a wander. Like much of Croatia, it's a very photogenic, charming and has an array of historic buildings to explore.

## Favourite Restaurants/Pubs in Crotia

* [Dalmatino](http://dalmatino-hvar.com/home/) in Hvar was incredible! I had the best gnocchi ever and the service was impeccable.
* Piccolo Ponte in Trogir had the most delicious pizzas, I have to say it was much better than any of the pizzas I had in Rome! 


## Top Tips
* Get off on the right foot - the vast majority of beaches in Croatia are pebble beaches so bring/purchase rock shoes if you like swimming
* Time and time again - ALL our catamarans were delayed so make sure you have water and sun cream as you are likely to be waiting in the heat 
* Cost effective - many sites say it's fine to take Kuna and Euros, however only hotels accepted Euros so you're much better off with Kunas
