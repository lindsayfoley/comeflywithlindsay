# A Travel Guide to Croatia

We were lucky enough to be invited to a family wedding in Hvar Croatia this year so we made the most of the trip by seeing as much as we could in the beautiful region of Dalmatia.

## Getting to the Split, Croatia

We drove to Gloucestershire from South London which took about 2 hours and 45 minutes. I highly recommend driving because a lot of the tourist attractions are widely spread across the counties so you can cover much more ground by car. Driving was also handy in the rainy/windy weather, I was very pleased we managed to avoid traipsing around in the drizzle and mud!

## Where to Stay in the Split

We stayed at [Cotswold House Hotel & Spa](http://www.cotswoldhouse.com) in Chipping Campden and found it was the ideal base for exploring the Cotswolds, as well as the local town. I loved this hotel because everything was perfectly in sync; the staff were friendly and professional, the contemporary decor was warm and inviting, the gardens were gorgeous, and the food was not only presented immaculately, it also tasted delicious.

The cottage was very spacious and well laid out, we had a cosy sleeping area and a separate seating space which looked out onto a lovely private garden and to my surprise a hot tub! It was tastefully decorated throughout with a luxurious bathroom and fab selection of Orla Kiely toiletries which were a real treat. One of the top things about staying here were the special touches which included, chewy homemade cookies in the room each day, returning in the evening to find that turndown service had been carried out, a proper tea set with long life milk in the fridge and also complimentary bottled water which was provided daily!

## Things to Do in the Split &amp; Places to Visit

We visited a few of the most popular, charming villages in the Cotswolds, they all looked like quintessential English towns that you would see in the movies and all had a reasonable selection of restaurants, cafes and pubs.
