# A Guide to York

If you were to picture the most perfect English city complete with meandering cobbled streets, crooked old character properties, neatly enclosed in medieval castle walls, that would certainly have to be York!

## Getting to York<a name="getting-there"></a>

It's quick and easy to get to York on the train from London with the journey taking a little over 2 hours on the train from London Kings Cross rail station to York train station. We greatly benefitted from booking our train tickets two months in advance which brought the cost to only £36 each for return tickets - a real bargain!

## Where to Stay in York<a name="accommodation"></a>

I did a <b>lot</b> of research to find the best place to stay in York before booking and as were going for my husbands birthday I was searching for a fancy hotel with a strong reputation, which absolutely had to have a pool (even though we never use it!) and was in close proximity to everything as we had no car. 

I booked The [Grand York hotel](https://www.booking.com/hotel/gb/cedar-court-grand.en-gb.html?aid=1912201) and all communication leading up to our arrival was great, after booking they email you a form so you can request things like a quiet room on a high floor and tell them if you are staying to celebrate a special occasion.

On arrival, the check-in process was smooth and we were able to get into our room a little earlier than expected and were kindly given two complimentary drinks to enjoy in our room. I was so impressed when we walked into the room, it was in the newer part of the building and was huge and modern and super spotless! 

It was perfect until I walked over to window and saw what were facing... something that looked like a bar or night club! I immediately knew my dreams of having a good nights sleep were over. On our first night, loud music started at around 10pm accompanied by shouting and screaming from rowdy people which lasted until 4am. Needless to say I complained the next morning and we were relocated to a suite in the old part of the building.

The noisy room aside, I didn't think much of this hotel if I'm being completely honest. It has a strong reputation and the building itself being the old headquarters of North Eastern Railway made it impressive but for me it lacked something and I didn't think it was worth £130+ a night.

There's a lot of hotels and B&B's in York to choose from so I would highly recommend staying elsewhere!

### York Minster and Dean's Park

This is really the top attraction in York and has the tourists to prove it! York Minister charges an entry fee so we didn't venture inside but we appreciated the intricate architecture and sat in the nearby Dean's Park to admire it.

## Favourite Restaurants/Pubs in York<a name="dining"></a>


## Bettys

That's [Bettys](https://www.bettys.co.uk/cafe-tea-rooms/our-locations/bettys-york) without an apostrophe, not just me making dozens of typos! 

I had been looking forward to having afternoon tea at Bettys ever since I booked it! I knew the food was going to be excellent and I was not disappointed! We had tea in a simplistic but elegant setting, accompanied by live piano music (some Disney tunes were even played!)

What I really like about Betty's was the menu, it wasn't the usual choice of stuffy sandwiches and boring scones - highlights included a tasty roasted red pepper and tomato tart, mini croissant with tea smoked salmon and creme fraiche and an incredible apple and vanilla custard tart.

I recommend booking Bettys well in advance and opting for the tea in the [Belmont Room](https://www.bettys.co.uk/bookable-afternoon-tea).

## The Star Inn the City

I booked the Star Inn to have dinner on my husbands birthday and it was great choice. The food was delicious and the service was very good, the only thing to bear in mind is you don't get a much of a view at night, especially when there's a storm so if you are looking for great views I'd recommend booking lunch here instead.

## The Forest at Galtres Lodge

So glad we stumbled upon The Forest resturant to have breakfast, just look at that mouthwatering stack of pancakes! This little cafe had a nice theme and a lot of foliage, it felt like we were dining at Tinkerbell's house.
