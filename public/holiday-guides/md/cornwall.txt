# Mawgan Porth in Newquay, Cornwall

Cornwall was a real surprise for me because I didn't expect to see such exquisite beaches with golden sand and ombre blue waters in England! I was stunned by how much beauty I saw on my short trip, especially the coastal views which really reminded me of being abroad somewhere like Portugal, it's hard to believe looking back on the photos that they were taken in an English county.

## Getting to Cornwall<a name="getting-there"></a>

Now this may sound lazy as I live in London, but after checking the driving route from home to Newquay I just couldn't bring myself to drive 6.5 hours to get there! We decided to get return flights to Newquay which cost us £70pp and probably would have been much cheaper if we didn't book so near the time of travel. We flew with Flybe from Gatwick airport which took only 40 minutes to reach Newquay. If you decide to fly too and plan to get a cab from the airport to your hotel, you must [pre-book a cab](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=3&awinaffid=467715&clickref=cornwall&p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.newquayairporttaxis.org%252F%5D%5D) either online or from the arrivals section of the airport, you can't simply walk up to the cab parking area to get one.

## Where to Stay in Cornwall<a name="accommodation"></a>

We stayed at 2 different accommodation types in Magwan Porth, Newquay:

### Seavista B&B 

If you are looking for a reasonably priced stay that's super close to the beach then look no further than [Seavista B&B](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=3&awinaffid=467715&clickref=cornwall&p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.seavista.co.uk%252F%5D%5D). We had a great welcome from Kate who runs the B&B and were shown to our cute, nautical themed room on arrival. The room was ideal for us, it was quiet and had a peaceful valley view, a lovely surprise of tasty, homemade flapjacks and divine Neal's Yard toiletries. You can wander down to the beach in no time at all from here, just take care as there is no pavement most of the way!

The breakfast at [Seavista B&B](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=3&awinaffid=467715&clickref=cornwall&p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.seavista.co.uk%252F%5D%5D) was a real treat for us, we had fresh smoothies, an assortment of breads and jams and a yummy, generous full English breakfast which totally set us up for the day!

### The Park Cornwall

We stayed in a luxury villa-type property called [Tewynn](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=3&awinaffid=467715&clickref=cornwall&p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Ftheparkcornwall.com%252Fproperties%252Ftewynn%252F%5D%5D) and it was just perfect for a large group of us and in a great location - only a 10 minute walk to Mawgan Porth beach. This property had 5 bedrooms, 3 of which had en-suite bathrooms, there was a generous living area and a surprisingly large, fully equipped kitchen. The balcony was the ideal spot to spend a summer evening and had vast views of moorland, hills and even sheep! We were also super lucky to have a private hot tub on the property which we of course took full advantage of. If you decide to stay here just make sure you bring your own toiletries as these aren't supplied. 

There are a couple of options if you plan to use the kitchen for cooking meals, you can do a food shop using Ocado and get this delivered to your property, or pop to Cornish Fresh near the beach which is ideal for snacks and stocks the essentials.

## Things to Do &amp; Places to Visit<a name="things-to-do"></a>

### Mawgan Porth Beach

[Mawgan Porth](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=3&awinaffid=467715&clickref=cornwall&p=%5B%5Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.mawganporth.info%252F%5D%5D) beach is small but very picturesque! We went here a couple of times because it was so close (and pretty), if you climb up the cliffs to the left of the beach you get great views of the town and the Cornish coast. There is also a path leading to Watergate Bay in this cliff, it is very hilly but well worth the exercise for the breathtaking views and beaches you will discover along the way.

### Watergate Bay

This beach is absolutely huge, it actually goes on for 2 miles as I found out when I attempted to walk the full length. The water looks amazing with hues of greens and blues, it's a definite must see if you're staying in Newquay.

## Favourite Restaurants/Pubs in Cornwall<a name="dining"></a>


## The Beach Hut
We stopped off here to cool down after trekking in the heat from Mawgan Porth! As it was boiling outside we decided to have caramelised banana sundaes which were as scrumptious as they sound! I liked [The Beach Hut](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=3&awinaffid=467715&clickref=cornwall&p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.watergatebay.co.uk%252Ffood-and-drink%252Fthe-beach-hut%252F%5D%5D), it was busy but had a nice vibe to it.

## The Merrymoor
A perfectly located pub, [The Merrymoor](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=3&awinaffid=467715&clickref=cornwall&p=%5B%5Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.merrymoorinn.com%252F%5D%5D) is just across the street from Mawgan Porth beach. We enjoyed a few drinks here in the garden before heading to Catch for our dinner.

## Catch
We really enjoyed the seafood at [Catch](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=3&awinaffid=467715&clickref=cornwall&p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.catchmawganporthbeach.co.uk%252F%5D%5D), the food was presented very well and was delicious! This is a nice place to enjoy an evening meal, with views of the beach and first class service.

## Top Tips<a name="tips"></a>
* Save time - if travelling from London, you are looking at about a 6.5 hour drive versus a 1 hour flight for around £50pp return
* Food, glorious food - don't forget to try a Cornish pasty and have some scones with jam and real Cornish clotted cream!
* Watch your step - not many pavements in Mawgan Porth so walking on the road at night can be scary with the lack of street lights
* Summer nights - it gets hot in the rooms at night (during summer) so make sure you are armed with bottles of water and light pjs

## Final Thoughts<a name="summary"></a>
We stayed in Cornwall for 3 nights in June 2018 to celebrate our lovely friends wedding! I could have easily spent a few more days exploring the sights of Cornwall. Our first 2 days were mainly spent roaming about town, checking out the beaches and the coast and walking about 20,000 steps a day - the next time I visit I will most definitely rent a car! When I return I'd like to see the [Bedruthan Steps](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=3&awinaffid=467715&clickref=cornwall&p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.nationaltrust.org.uk%252Fcarnewas-at-bedruthan%252F%5D%5D), go to the [Eden Project](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=3&awinaffid=467715&clickref=cornwall&p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.edenproject.com%252F%5D%5D) and visit Newquay town centre as well as Padstow.
