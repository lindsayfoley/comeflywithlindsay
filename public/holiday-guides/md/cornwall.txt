# 2 Days Visiting Mawgan Porth In Cornwall, England

Cornwall was a real surprise for me, I did not expect to see such exquisite beaches with golden sand and ombre blue waters. I was stunned by how much beauty there was, it really reminded me of being abroad somewhere like Portugal and it definetely didn't feel like I was in southwest England!

## Getting to Cornwall

Now this may sound lazy as I am based in London, England but after checking the driving route from home to Newquay, I couldn't bring myself to drive 6.5 hours to get there! We decided to get return flights to Newquay for £70pp, it would have been cheaper if we didn't book so near to the time when we were due to travel. We flew with Flybe from Gatwick and it took a mere 40 minutes to reach Newquay airport! Big tip for you, if you decided to fly too and plan to get a cab from the airport to your hotel, you must pre-book this cab in the arrivals section of the airport, you can't simply walk up to the cab line in the airport car park.

### The Park Cornwall

We stayed in a luxury villa-type property called [Tewynn](https://theparkcornwall.com/properties/tewynn/) and it was just perfect for a large group of us and in a great location - only a 10 minute walk to Mawgan Porth beach. This property had 5 bedrooms, 3 of which had en-suite bathrooms, it had a generous living area and surprisingly large, fully equipped kitchen. The balcony was the ideal spot to spend a summer evening and had views of greenery, hills and sheep. We also had a hot tub which we of course took full advantage of.

If you decide to stay here just make sure you bring your own toiletries as these aren't supplied and don't forget to bring beach towels. If you need to get food to stock up the fridge, you can do an Ocado order to arrive or visit Cornish Fresh which is large newsagents near the beach which doesn't carry the range of products that you would get at a supermarket but is good for snacks.

## Top Tips
* Save time - if travelling from London, you are looking at about a 6.5 hour drive versus a 1 hour flight for around £50 return pp
* Watch your step - there's not many pavements in Mawgan Porth so walking on the road at night can be scary as there are no street lights!
* Summer nights - it gets very hot and stuffy in the rooms at night so make sure you pack a lot of water and lightweight pjs

## Final Thoughts 
We stayed in Cornwall for 3 nights in June 2018 to celebrate our friends wedding. We spent the first 2 days exploring the town and beaches on foot and the next I visit I will most definitely rent a car! When I return I'd like to see the [Bedruthan Steps](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/carnewas-at-bedruthan), checkout the [Eden Project](https://www.edenproject.com/) and visit Newquay town centre as well as Padstow.
