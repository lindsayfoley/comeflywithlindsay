# 2 Days Visiting Mawgan Porth In Cornwall, England

Cornwall was a real surprise for me because I didn't expect to see such exquisite beaches with golden sand and ombre blue waters in England! I was stunned by how much beauty I saw on my short trip, especially the costal views which really reminded me of being abroad somewhere like Portugal, it's hard to believe looking back on the photos that they were taken in an English county of all places.

## Getting to Cornwall

Now this may sound lazy as I live in London, but after checking the driving route from home to Newquay I just couldn't bring myself to drive 6.5 hours to get there! We decided to get return flights to Newquay which cost us £70pp and probably would have been much cheaper if we didn't book so near to the time of travel. We flew with Flybe from Gatwick which took only 40 minutes to reach Newquay airport. If you decide to fly too and plan to get a cab from the airport to your hotel, you must pre-book this cab in the arrivals section of the airport, you can't simply walk up to the cab parking area in the airport car park to arrange a ride.

### The Park Cornwall

We stayed in a luxury villa-type property called [Tewynn](https://theparkcornwall.com/properties/tewynn/) and it was just perfect for a large group of us and in a great location - only a 10 minute walk to Mawgan Porth beach. This property had 5 bedrooms, 3 of which had en-suite bathrooms, there was a generous living area and a surprisingly large, fully equipped kitchen. The balcony was the ideal spot to spend a summer evening and had vast views of moorland, hills and even sheep! We were also super lucky to have a private hot tub on the property which we of course took full advantage of.

If you decide to stay here just make sure you bring your own toiletries as these aren't supplied. There are a couple of options if you are looking to take advantage of the kitchen for cooking, you can do a food shop using Ocado which you can get delivered right to your property, there is also Cornish Fresh which is a decent newsagents near the beach which doesn't carry the range of products that you would get at a supermarket but it's good for snacks and has the basics.

## Top Tips
* Save time - if travelling from London, you are looking at about a 6.5 hour drive versus a 1 hour flight for around £50pp return
* Food, glorious food - don't forget to try a Cornish pasty and have some scones with jam and real Cornish clotted cream!
* Watch your step - there's not many pavements in Mawgan Porth so walking on the road at night can be scary as there are no street lights
* Summer nights - it gets very hot and stuffy in the rooms at night (during summer) so make sure you are armed with bottles of water and lightweight pjs

## Final Thoughts 
We stayed in Cornwall for 3 nights in June 2018 to celebrate our friends wedding and I would have loved to have spent a couple more days exploring. We spent the first 2 days roaming about town, checking out the beaches and the coast, walking about 20,000 steps a day so the next I visit I will most definitely rent a car! When I return I'd like to see the [Bedruthan Steps](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/carnewas-at-bedruthan), go to the [Eden Project](https://www.edenproject.com/) and visit Newquay town centre as well as Padstow.
