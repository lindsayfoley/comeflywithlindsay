					<h1>Afternoon Tea in London, England</h1>
					<p>I've been fortunate to experience traditional afternoon tea in some of London's most exquisite venues. With so many options available, I've put together this little guide to showcase my top picks, listed in order of my preference to provide you with a helping hand!</p>

					<h3>Traditional Afternoon Tea At Fortnum &amp; Mason - Mayfair</h3>
					<p>The Diamond Jubilee Tea Salon is just lovely and is the perfect setting to enjoy a luxurious afternoon tea, featuring exquisite food and outstanding 5-star service. We were given a great selection of teas and sandwiches which I enjoyed, but the sweet treats are really the showstoppers here. The scones were delicious and served with lemon curd, clotted cream and strawberry jam and the top tier of the cake stand featured rich, flawless looking pastries. The tea salon has a tranquil atmosphere, with live music being played on the grand piano - you can easily forget you're dining in a busy department store in the heart of London! At the end of our tea, our waiter very kindly packed up our lemon curd, jam, leftover pastries and offered us slices of cakes that we were too full try, so we could enjoy these at home.</p>
					<p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.fortnumandmason.com/restaurants/afternoon-tea">Fortnum &amp; Mason</a> tea is &pound;44 per person and is more laid back than tea at The Ritz/Dorchester, making it perfect for all occasions.</p>

					<h3>Traditional Afternoon Tea At The Ritz - Mayfair</h3>
					<p>It was a joy to dine in such an elegant setting with striking floral arrangements and opulent chandeliers which  perfectly complimented the Ritz' Renaissance decor. The sandwiches here were delicious and moreish, we easily made our way through 2 plates of these! Both scones and cakes were light and very tasty, and we were offered a second helping of these dishes. The service was great, a bit fastidious at times and not as relaxed as Fortnum &amp; Mason, but overall it was a lovely, memorable dining experience.</p>
					<p>Afternoon tea at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theritzlondon.com/dine-with-us/afternoon-tea/">The Ritz</a> is priced at &pound;54 per person and is ideal for celebrating special occasions or purchased for a loved one as a gift.</p>

					<h3>Tale As Old As Time Tea, Town House At The Kensington - Kensington</h3>
					<p>I was so excited to secure a booking at this extremely popular tea! Being themed around my favourite childhood Disney film, I had high hopes for the menu and was interested to see how the execution would come together. Upon arrival, my first thoughts were how beautiful the Town House hotel was, the decor was tasteful and the tea room was so cosy. The service was good and the waiter was engaging and explained each food item to us well. Surprisingly, there were no scones, no scones at an afternoon tea which I thought was the major downfall of this tea.</p>

					<h2>My Top Tips</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Food glorious food - if you book the last seating, usually around 7pm you'll normally get extra sandwiches and cakes</li>
						<li>All about ambience - there's nothing quite like afternoon tea during Christmas and most venues add a festive twist to their menus</li>
					</ul>
