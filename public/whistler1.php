					<h1>Whistler Village, Canada</h1>
					<p>Hiking, biking, skiing... definitely a must stop destination for all adventure seekers. Whistler is north of Vancouver and is where the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics were hosted, it's also home to Whistler Blackcomb which is a very popular ski resort.</p>

					<p>We travelled to Whistler from Vancouver International Airport on the Whistler Shuttle which took about 2.5 hours. The Whistler shuttles depart from the airport every hour so it's a great choice if you don't have a car. The views on the drive are just beautiful, you pass through Downtown Vancouver, Stanley Park and then have the ocean, trees and glacier covered mountains beside you. Whistler village is a pedestrianised, quaint, little town and has the most amazing red and autumnal coloured trees. In comparison to Banff, it feels smaller and more compact. There are shops, restaurants, bars and hotels and you can explore the whole village on foot in about 20 minutes. We stayed at Summit Lodge Boutique Hotel located in the heart of the village.</p>

					<p>We attempted to do the Rainbow trail but the Rainbow lake was just too far for us to make it to. We did manage to get to Alta Lake and Rainbow Falls which was really cool but let me warn you, a longggg walk for those who aren't fit; about a 3 hour roundtrip journey.</p>

					<p>The Lost Lake trail was a nice easy one to do from Whistler Village.</p>

					<p>Unfortunately for us, we arrived during off season which meant most things were closed.</p>

					<p>We stayed in Whistler for 3 nights in October 2017 and I would say this is the perfect amount of time. When I return, I'd like to do the activities that were closed, try out the gondola.</p>

					<h2>My Top Tips</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Check the schedule - you want to make sure it's not between seasons</li>
						<li>Rent a bike - there's loads of places to do this and plenty of safe cycle lanes</li>
						<li>Book restaurants - it gets very busy in this little town and make bookings</li>
					</ul>
