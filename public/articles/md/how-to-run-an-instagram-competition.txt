#  How to Run an Instagram Competition
##### April 10, 2018

I ran my first ever competition on [@comeflwithlindsay](https://www.instagram.com/comeflywithlindsay/) this month and I definitely learned a great deal in a short space of time! There wasn't a whole lot of helpful info on the web about running one, so I thought I'd create this post to give you a guiding hand.

### Prior to Launching the Instagram Competition
* **Collaboration**  it's important to select a brand that fits nicely with your own brand, and one with a much lower following than your account.   
* **Prize** choose a prize that's relevant to your audience e.g. if you're a travel blogger it makes no sense to give away a bandana for a dog! 
* **Audience** know your audience! This is going to validate if it's a wise idea to run the competition you have in mind. Think about where you can dispatch your prize to, is it going to be to sent to the UK only, UK and Ireland, Worldwide? If your Instagram account is a business account, you can view stats to find out where your followers are located. Go to your profile and tap the bar graph icon next to your name, scroll to 'Followers' and then tap 'See more' to see the top locations of your followers. You might find a large proportion may not be able to enter the giveaway, therefore your engagement and number of entrants will be lower than anticipated.
* **Time** in your stats you can also see the times and days of the week that your followers are most active. This will help you to pinpoint the best time of day to post.
* **Duration** I recommend having the competition active for the duration of 3 days, anything more may annoy your followers because you'll be pushing the competition in your posts and stories daily until it ends.
* **Entry** I opted to have entrants follow my page and the brand I was working with as a requirement to enter. This worked well for me and it wasn't too demanding to ask users to do.
* **Hashtags** this is an area which I could have improved greatly, I looked at other competition posts for inspiration and I noticed a lot used #UKgiveaway #UKcompetition, etc. I feel like this attracted users (or bots!) who were only concerned with entering competitions and had no intention of using the platform for anything else and this was heavily reflected on their page. It's not about getting a large volume of low quality followers - you want followers who are going to engage with your account so avoid those types of hashtags.
* **Targets** have a rough target in mind of how many followers you want to gain for the brand you are working with. I guesstimated 50 and didn't communicate this with the brand that I was collaborating with, purely because I was nervous that I might only end up with 10 as I had no experience carrying out a giveaway! Luckily I managed to get get an increase of 47 followers for us both and this will be really valuable going forward as I now have something to base future competitions on.
* **Preparation** before you launch the competition, select or create an image, write the caption and search for suitable hashtags to promote the post. Use all 30 hashtags to maximise the reach of the post! I used an app called [Over](https://madewithover.com/) to overlay text on my chosen images.
* **Terms** don't forget to add in a line stating who is eligible, e.g. entrants over 18 who are UK residents. Also include when the competition will end and when the winner will be announced. I did see articles saying that you should include a sentence about how the competition is not affiliated or endorsed by Instagram, however I didn't do this but if you are worried feel free to add it in.
* **Screenshot** you'll want to screenshot your page and the brands page so you know how many followers you have before you begin the competition. To get this as accurate as possible, I took my screenshots a few minutes before I launched the competition.

### During the Instagram Competition
* **Advertising** I created one post per day and a story to go alongside it, leading users to my page to enter the competition. I also asked the brand I was collaborating with to repost. I had 8k followers and for each post I got an average of 500 likes and 22 comments/entrants.
* **Validate entries** I didn't do this and it would have been beneficial as some entrants followed me but not the brand I collaborated with!
* **Experiment** as I was totally new to this, I took the opportunity to test different call to actions on my posts, different styles of images and a variety of hashtags. 

I found that my first post performed the best out of all three of my posts:
* First post - image of the prize, call to action 'WIN!' with a very long, detailed caption
* Second post - same image of the prize with a different call to action 'ENTER TO WIN' and 'ENDS TOMORROW!' I used the same caption but half the hashtags were different. I worried 'WIN!' wasn't enough on my initial post so tried to use more action orientated copy on this post.
* Last post - different image of the prize in a collage with the copy, a more sophisticated image I would say! Call to action 'LAST CHANCE TO WIN enter now', the caption was very simplified and again half of the hashtags were different from the other 2 posts. My tactic here was to drive urgency and I have to say this post performed really well considering it wasn't live for as long as the other 2.

### When the Instagram Competition Ends
* **Archiving** you want to remove the posts ASAP when the competition ends so that you don't risk people entering or liking the posts, which will skew your date. You can archive posts by clicking the 3 dots in the top right corner of the post. Archiving removes the post from being displayed publicly and instead it's still accessible for you, just click the clock icon on your profile to view the archived posts.
* **Verify entrants** check your conditions to enter have been met and make a list of all valid entrants. I did this on Instagram via my desktop, to make it easy to copy and paste the comments into a spreadsheet, remove duplicates and then I began the painful process of checking each entrant followed my account and the brand I was working with. Note, if an entrant has a private account, the only way you can check that they are following you is to visit their profile and confirm the text on the blue button says 'Follow back' and not 'Follow'.
* **Winner** when I had my list of valid entrants, I Googled 'random name picker' and was able to paste in my list and click a button that selected a winner. I then featured the winner in a story asking them to DM the brand directly to claim their prize.
* **Growth** it's important to remember when you are measuring the growth increase when the competition is over, you need to account for unfollows, so if you gained 50 new followers and you are only seeing your followers increase by 30, this is most likely due to unfollows or removal of spam accounts that occurred whilst the competition was active.
* **Logging** it's always a good idea to record how the competition went so the next time you run one, you have some historical data to use as a benchmark. Archiving the posts are one thing but it's sensible to create a document with high level stats such as overall entrants/followers gained and log the amount of likes, comments and entrants per post too. It's also really helpful to send a summary of the competition results to the brand you are working with so they see the performance.

That's it! If you have any questions about the above I'm always happy to help so please feel free to [ask me](/contact)!
