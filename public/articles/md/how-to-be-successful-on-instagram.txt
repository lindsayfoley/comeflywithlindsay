#  How to be Successful on Instagram
##### April 5, 2018

I created my [@comeflwithlindsay](https://www.instagram.com/comeflywithlindsay/) Instagram account in October, a month before I launched this site in November 2017. For me this worked incredibly well because I was able to get an audience growing whilst I was still developing my site, and when I had my assets created like my logo, I slowly began incorporating this into my Instagram profile so that it mirrored my site as much as possible.

My list encompasses what I’ve learned about growing an Instagram account, I have gained over 8k followers since October 2017!

### Instagram Tips
* **Settings** firstly, you are going to want to upgrade your account from a personal one to a business account on Instagram through the settings panel. This involves creating a Facebook group page as part of the process, however you don't have to use the Facebook page at all to get going. The business account provides you with analytics so you can measure your activity and see how each post performs.
* **Timing** post regularly and post ideally between 6-9pm to get the most exposure.
* **Hashtags** Instagram will allow you to add a maximum of 30 hashtags to your post, I recommend using all 30 and searching for each one in Instagram first to see how many associated posts there are for each tag. I’ve read sites that recommend going for hashtags with lower than 50k of posts, however I always target the hashtags with millions of posts and this seems to work very well for me! One massive tip though - change your hashtags regularly to avoid being shadowbanned.
* **Posts** you want to find that sweet spot to ensure you are not bombarding your followers, or not posting frequently enough to keep them engaged. I try to post at least once a week, and if I don't have anything meaningful to post I create a couple of stories so I am still interacting with my audience.
* **Engagement pods** an [engagement pod](https://blog.markgrowth.com/everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-instagram-engagement-pods-7bf1873b250e) is basically a group message between members with similar accounts to your own. When you post a new picture, you write a message in the engagement pod and each member then has to like the post, save it and comment on it within an hour of you posting it (ideally). The idea is that your post gains popularity quickly and therefore appears at the top of your followers newsfeeds, giving your post a greater reach. This is something I've tried and tested and it's ok when the engagement pod has under 10 followers, any more and you might struggle to keep up! 
* **$1.80 strategy** this involves picking a hashtag and searching for it on Instagram, looking at the top 9 posts and adding a meaningful comment on each one. You are meant to add your 2 cents for 90 posts a day, adding up to [$1.80](https://www.garyvaynerchuk.com/1-80-instagram-strategy-grow-business-brand/) I don't have the time to do 90 but I certainly try to do at least 20 in a day. 
* **Shadowbanning** if you've noticed a drop in your engagement or your posts are not showing up under your hashtags, it's likely that you've been [shadowbanned](https://later.com/blog/instagram-shadowban/). If you are shadowbanned your posts are not visible to users who aren't following you, which annoyingly means you are unable to grow your audience. If this happens to you, change up your hashtags completely for your next post, along with the formatting and avoid all things 'spammy' such as a lot of emoji's in the descriptions and just duplicating your previous post hashtags.
* **Activity** you need to spend a lotttt of time on Instagram, particularly at the beginning when you have a young following. Being social on social media is important, which totally makes sense I guess!
* **Follow/unfollow** I know this is a bit controversial, but there are certain things you can do to jump start and accerlerate your following growth. One way is to search for accounts similar to yours and follow them. If those accounts don't follow you back after a certain period of time, say 24 hours you just unfollow them.
* **Replies** always reply to those who have taken the time to comment on your posts or send you a DM.
* **New posts** I have seen success in acquiring new followers by looking for posts that have been posted in the last 10 minutes and following accounts that have liked the post.
* **Apps** There are apps available to help you manage your followers, there are some free ones that are decent like 'Followers & Likes on Instagram', however as your account grows you may want something with more features. At the moment I am using 'Followers Pro for Instagram' which is great for my needs, it helps me to find accounts that unfollow me and I can easily unfollow them directly from the app. I can also see data on my followers, e.g.measure my account growth and view my most popular posts.
* **Stories** I like using stories, mainly to support my Instagram posts that I have posted that day, or to showcase my activity that is not quite post-worthy! [Stories](https://www.socialmediatoday.com/social-business/why-and-how-use-instagram-stories) help to get your brands personality across, in a way that posts just can't do, for instance you can upload videos, create polls, give shoutouts to your friends, etc. it certainly adds another dimension of interaction for you account.
