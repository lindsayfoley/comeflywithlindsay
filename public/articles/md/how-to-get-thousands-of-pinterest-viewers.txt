# How to Get Thousands of Pinterest Viewers
##### June 18, 2018

I've had my Pinterest account [comeflwithlindsay](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/comeflywithlindsay/) for many years now and it was predominantly used to create mood boards and to house ideas for things I wanted to make, bake or recreate in some shape or form! But in the last couple of weeks I've been utilising it as a marketing channel which has driven substantial traffic to this very site.

### How it works

So the idea is you create a master pin and this gets duplicated by others through re-pinning. It's really simple and is very similar to retweeting for those of you who have experience using Twitter.

The first step is to create a bunch of your own pins, I use a free app called [Over](https://madewithover.com/) to overlay text onto my favourite portrait images. As you can see from the below, my pins are dead simple - I have a headline at the top and my logo and the bottom and that's it! I aim to create about 10 pins for each travel guide that I have published on site.

### Setting up your Pinterest account
* ** Sign-up ** if you haven't already got a Pinterest account for your blog then [sign up](https://www.pinterest.com/join/register/email/), or you could always opt to change your existing account to a business one too - I did this as it was the simplest option for me
* ** Business account ** go to settings and change your account to a business account, this will provide you with a whole bunch of useful analytics to track your performance to see which pins and boards are working hardest for you
* ** Analytics ** you'll see 'Claim website' in settings, if you follow the steps to do this it will unlock a whole set of stats specifically focused on pinned content from your site - it's not 100% necessary but it's certainly a nice to have!
* ** Boards ** start creating some boards relevant to your chosen industry and add a few pins so they aren't blank. As travel is my industry, I started with 10 different destinations boards weaving in some of my own pins (if appropriate!) so I was actively promoting my brand in the process.

### The most important section

If you are going to take anything away from reading this, it must be to join as many group boards as humanely possible! The more group boards that you are a contributor on, the more exposure your pins will get. 

Group boards can be hard to identify when you are new to this. You want to look for a circle on the bottom of the board picture to be divided into 3 pictures. If you visit [my page](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/comeflywithlindsay/) you'll see most of my group boards appear in the middle. Click into any group board and you can see who runs the board, how many pins/followers it has, the board rules and joining instructions. 

To join group board you usually have to do either of the following:
1. DM the board owner asking to be a collaborator
2. Email the board owner if they have included their email address on the board summary
3. Visit their website and complete an online form if they have specified this


Here are my top three ways to finding group boards on Pinterest:
1. [Boardboosters](https://boardbooster.com/best-group-boards) is a popular choice for tracking down these group boards and joining them
2. [Pingroupie](http://pingroupie.com/) similar to Boardboosters, another tool to make this easier and to filter by segments
3. Find someone who has joined a lot of group boards... say me (if relevant to your audience) and request to join all the same ones

** Success = joining as many group board as you can! **

### Maintaining growth without injury

Now the injury part is the repetitive strain injury that you will encounter when trying to grow this account manually!! My paws are crippled with pain as I was trying to do this alone until I stumbled upon [Tailwind](https://www.tailwindapp.com/i/comeflywithlindsay). I saw references to [Tailwind](https://www.tailwindapp.com/i/comeflywithlindsay) pretty much everywhere, it was getting a lot of good press so I decided to check it out to see what all the hype was about. 

Tailwind basically allows you to schedule content on Pinterest and Instagram. I haven't used it on Insta so I can't comment on this but for Pinterest it's been incredible. It has many helpful features like you can create a board list which can include every group board that you are a contributor on and then create a new pin and upload it to Tailwind and assign your group board distribution list to it. Then tell it how many pins you want to schedule a day (I do 35) and hit schedule and let Tailwind do all of the hard work.

It's probably a bit abstract trying to work out how exactly this can help you when you have no familiarity of the tool. I recommend signing up to the free trial because the registration process is quick, you don't have to enter card details and it gives you 100 pins to schedule for free. 

For me this tool has worked wonders so I encourage you to give it a go and if it does make a real difference for you, subscribing on the annual plan works out to be Â£5 per month for unlimited pins which is amazing value when you think about it. 

As always if you have any questions about the above I'm always happy to help so please feel free to [shout](/contact)!
