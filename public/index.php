							<h2><a href="/holiday-guides/banff">Banff National Park, Canada</a></h2>
							<p>Definitely one of the most beautiful places, possibly in existence</p>
							<p>Behold stunning mountain scenery in every direction that you look. Banff was my first stop on my recent 2 week holiday to the West coast of Canada. I visited in October to get a glimpse of the the autumnal colours in Canada in fall, and I was not disappointed!</p>

							<h2><a href="/holiday-guides/vancouver">Downtown Vancouver, Canada</a></h2>
							<p>Easily one of the best cities I have ever had the pleasure of visiting</p>
							<p>Cycling around Stanley Park, roaming around Gastown and Yaletown, these are just a few of my favourite moments spent in downtown Vancouver. There's a lot to do in and see in Van, you may even see something being filmed! I'd recommend at least 5 nights here.</p>
