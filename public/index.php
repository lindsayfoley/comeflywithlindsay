			<h2>Travelling The World One Stop At A Time</h2>
			<p>With so many spectacular places to visit, I find the web inundated with travel information, resources, reviews, etc. that can make the whole planning/booking process really stressful and pressurising with the fear of not picking the prime location or the right hotel!</p>
			<p>To make things simple and convenient for those like me, I wanted to document my travels to give you an honest insight into areas that I visit and advise on the good, the bad and the ugly.</p>
			<p>So let me be your travel <span class="crossed-out">guinea pig</span> guru and I'll tell you where I think is best to stay, what to see and what activities I recommend doing.</p>

							<h2><a href="/holiday-guides/carvoeiro">Carvoeiro, Portugal</a></h2>
							<p>A lovely quaint town located in the popular Algarve in Portugal</p>
							<p>Many of you may be unfamiliar with the little town of Carvoeiro; an idyllic area in the Algarve and one of the most beautiful places I've visited in Europe. Carvoeiro was our winter escape and we didn't expect it to be so peaceful or to have so much stunning scenery!</p>

							<h2><a href="/holiday-guides/afternoon-tea-london">Afternoon Tea, London</a></h2>
							<p>A quintessential English custom introduced in Britain in 1840</p>
							<p>With so many places to choose from including top hotels, tea rooms, upmarket department stores and even museums! Afternoon tea in London can be found almost anywhere - so here are my top picks to help narrow things down!</p>

							<h2><a href="/holiday-guides/banff">Banff National Park, Canada</a></h2>
							<p>Definitely one of the most beautiful places, possibly in existence</p>
							<p>Behold stunning mountain scenery in every direction that you look. Banff was my second stop on my recent 2 week holiday to the West coast of Canada. I visited in October to get a glimpse of the the autumnal colours in Canada in fall and I was not disappointed!</p>

							<h2><a href="/holiday-guides/vancouver">Downtown Vancouver, Canada</a></h2>
							<p>Easily one of the best cities I have ever had the pleasure of visiting</p>
							<p>Cycling around Stanley Park, roaming around Gastown and Yaletown, these are just a few of my favourite moments spent in this vibrant city. There's an abundance of things to do and see in Vancouver and hopefully this guide will help you to prioritise and plan.</p>
