							<h2><a href="/holiday-guides/banff">Banff National Park, Canada</a></h2>
							<p>Definitely one of the most beautiful places, possibly in existence</p>
							<p>Behold stunning mountain scenery in every direction that you look. Banff was my second stop on my recent 2 week holiday to the West coast of Canada. I visited in October to get a glimpse of the the autumnal colours in Canada in fall and I was not disappointed!</p>

							<h2><a href="/holiday-guides/vancouver">Downtown Vancouver, Canada</a></h2>
							<p>Easily one of the best cities I have ever had the pleasure of visiting</p>
							<p>Cycling around Stanley Park, roaming around Gastown and Yaletown, these are just a few of my favourite moments spent in this vibrant city. There's an abundance of things to do and see in Vancouver and hopefully this guide will help you to prioritise and plan.</p>
