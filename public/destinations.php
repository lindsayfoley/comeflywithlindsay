							<h2><a href="carvoeiro">Carvoeiro, Portugal</a></h2>
							<p>Many of you may be unfamiliar with this little town in Lagao. Carvoeiro is an idyllic area in the Algarve and one of the most beautiful places I've visited in Europe. Carvoeiro was our winter escape in December 2017 and we didn't expect it to be so peaceful or to have so much stunning scenery!</p>

							<p>With so many places to choose from including top hotels, tea rooms, upmarket department stores and even museums!

It's divided into several neighbourhoods with good shopping centres, dining options, museums, as well as spas.</p>

							<h2><a href="banff">Banff National Park, Canada</a></h2>
							<p>Filled with incredible snow tipped mountains in every direction you look, Banff was my second stop on my 2 week holiday to the West coast of Canada. I visited Banff National Park in October to see the famous Rocky Mountains and picturesque lakes and it was truly one of the best experiences ever.</p>
