							<h5>The Obligatory About Page</h5>
							<p>Thanks for popping by, I'm Lindsay Foley *waves* and I loveeee to travel. I try to escape my hometown of England a few times a year to see what wondrous sites are out there for me to see and discover.</p>
							<p>Hopefully my featured destinations will be helpful for you when planning upcoming holidays. I'll give you tips on where to stay/where to go/where not to go, advice and provide cool photography <span>mainly of food I eat, mostly burgers</span> along the way.</p>
							<p>Big shout out to the lovely <a target="_blank" href="https://travelthroughlife.co.uk/">Hannah Denton</a> for inspiring me to start my own blog (blame her for my ramblings)! Now go ahead and have a look around the place and please feel free to get in touch if you have any questions about my travels...or me!</p>
