							<h1>The Obligatory About Page</h1>
							<p>I'm Lindsay and I love to travel! I try to escape London when I can to see what wondrous sites are out there for me to discover.</p>
							<p>My day job is a <a target="_blank" href="http://lindsayfoley.co.uk">Web Developer</a>, which has been priceless in creating and designing this very site that sits before your eyes! I intend to travel a LOT and utilise my creative and dev skills to create these travel guides featuring cool photography <span class="crossed-out">mainly of food I eat, mostly burgers</span> along the way.</p>
							<p>Shout-out to the lovely <a target="_blank" href="https://travelthroughlife.co.uk/">Hannah Denton</a> for inspiring me to start this site (blame her for my ramblings)! So take a look around and get in touch if you have any questions about my travels/me!</p>
