							<h5><a href="whistler">Whistler Village, Canada</a></h5>
							<p>A cool little town with a focus on sports and outdoor activities</p>
							<p>Hiking, biking, skiing... definitely a must stop destination for all adventure seekers. Whistler was a lovely town with the most amazing autumnal trees, but unfortunately for me it was off season when we arrived, meaning a lot of the top attractions were closed.</p>
