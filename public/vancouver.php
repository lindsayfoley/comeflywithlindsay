							<h5><a href="vancouver">Vancouver, Canada</a></h5>
							<p>Easily one of the best cities I have ever had the pleasure of visiting</p>
							<p>Cycling around Stanley Park, roaming around Gastown and Yaletown, these are just a few of my favourite moments spent in downtown Vancouver. There's a lot to do in and see in Van, you may even see something being filmed! I'd recommend at least 5 nights here.</p>
