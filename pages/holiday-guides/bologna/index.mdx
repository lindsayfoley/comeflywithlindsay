# Exploring Bologna: Italy’s Culinary and Cultural Capital

<PostDetails dateUpdated="Nov 2024" />

Bologna, the vibrant capital of Emilia-Romagna in northern Italy, is an absolute must-visit destination. Known for its exquisite food, rich history, and beautiful architecture, it’s a city that’s perfect for a long weekend. Despite visiting in November when it was freezing—even colder than London — the chill didn’t dampen our experience. The charm of this northern Italian city more than made up for the cold weather!

## Where to Stay in Bologna<a name="accommodation"></a>

We stayed at the <ExternalLink
cta="Art Hotel Commercianti"
href="https://booking.tp.st/NFUQSLot"
/>, a four-star hotel in the heart of Bologna. Tucked away down a quiet side street just off the main square, this hotel was in a perfect location. It offered both peace and proximity—everything was right on our doorstep, but we enjoyed quiet, restful nights.

The decor of the hotel was traditional and elegant, with historic artwork throughout the property, creating a charming atmosphere. We stayed in a Classic Double Room, which was both comfortable and beautifully designed, perfect for a weekend getaway.

Breakfast was great, offering a continental buffet with both sweet and savoury options to set you up for the day.

## Things to Do in Bologna<a name="things-to-do"></a>

<br />

### Piazza Maggiore

<p>
  <ExternalLink
    cta="Piazza Maggiore"
    href="https://www.bolognawelcome.com/en/places/squares-streets-monuments/piazza-maggiore-2"
  />{" "}
  is the heart of Bologna, and we found ourselves walking through it regularly
  during our stay. Surrounded by shops, restaurants, and bars, the square has a
  lively atmosphere and is a must-see even if you’re not staying nearby.
</p>

### Basilica di San Petronio

Located in Piazza Maggiore, this grand <ExternalLink
cta="basilica"
href="https://www.bolognawelcome.com/en/places/religious-buildings/basilica-of-san-petronio-eng"
/> offers free admission. It’s well worth stepping inside to admire the stunning architecture and get a sense of Bologna’s history.

### Fontana del Nettuno

Also situated in Piazza Maggiore, this iconic fountain is a landmark you can’t miss—even if you don’t plan to visit it intentionally. It’s especially beautiful when lit up at night.

### La Piccola Venezia

We were a bit disappointed by this spot, as the canal was completely dried up when we visited! If you’re considering a <ExternalLink
cta="visit"
href="https://www.bolognawelcome.com/it/luoghi/vie-e-cammini/finestrella-di-via-piella"
/>, check ahead to see if there’s water in the canals—it may save you a trip.

### Porticoes

Bologna’s famous porticoes are a unique feature of the city and something you’ll encounter naturally as you explore. These historic covered walkways are both beautiful and practical, especially in colder weather.

### Torre dell’Orologio

One of the highlights of our trip was climbing the <ExternalLink
cta="clocktower"
href="https://torreorologio.visitmuve.it/en/home/"
/> in Piazza Maggiore. For €10 per person, you can explore the clock mechanism and enjoy multiple viewing platforms with breathtaking views of the city. Be sure to time your visit for sunset for the most stunning experience.

## Dining in Bologna<a name="dining"></a>

Bologna is truly a food lover’s paradise! Every meal was 10/10, and the city lived up to its reputation as the culinary capital of Italy.

### **Trattoria da Me**

On our first night, we visited <ExternalLink
cta="Trattoria da Me"
href="https://www.trattoriadame.it/"
/>, which was exactly the relaxed experience we needed after traveling. For starters, we enjoyed crescentina bread—a traditional fried bread—paired with delicious cured meats, a perfect intro to Bologna’s culinary traditions. The restaurant’s cosy atmosphere and great menu made it an ideal start to our trip. Conveniently, it was just a 20-minute walk from our hotel, and the stroll itself was lovely, taking us past busy shops and inviting bars and restaurants along the way.

### Ahimè

For a truly special dining experience in Bologna, we visited <ExternalLink cta="Ahimè" href="https://www.ahime.it/" />. Known for its innovative and imaginative approach to food, Ahimè offers a tasting menu that highlights modern interpretations of traditional Bolognese cuisine.

Each course was intricately prepared and beautifully presented, with the tortellini being a standout for me! Perfectly cooked and bursting with flavour, it was one of the most memorable dishes of the evening. The tasting menu itself was a really nice surprise, as we didn’t know ahead of time what would be served, making the experience even more exciting.

The restaurant is small and cosy, with a minimalist yet inviting interior. The intimate setting paired with the creative dishes made this a dining experience we won’t forget. If you’re in Bologna and looking for something unique, <ExternalLink cta="Ahimè" href="https://www.ahime.it/" /> is absolutely worth a visit.

On our last night, we dined at <ExternalLink
cta="Vicolo Colombina"
href="https://www.vicolocolombina.it/"
/>, which was conveniently just a few minutes’ walk from our hotel—ideal on a cold evening! The food was delicious, and the intimate setting made it the perfect way to wrap up our trip.
