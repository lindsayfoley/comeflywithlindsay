## Getting to Painshill Park<a name="getting-there"></a>

We drove to <ExternalLink
cta="Painshill Park"
href="https://www.painshill.co.uk/contact-painshill/"
/> which is located just off the M25 in Cobham, Surrey. It has a large, free car park which can get quite busy so I recommend getting there at a reasonable time!

## Top 5 Things to See at Painshill Park<a name="things-to-see"></a>

I don't want to spoil all the fun so I'll take you through some of my favourites, but do note there are other beautiful garden buildings and follies to see which I haven't mentioned below.

## 1. The Gothic Temple

The Gothic Temple was the highlight for me, not only is it a pretty structure but it also boasts some incredible views - you're going to want to do a full on photoshoot here! The inside is charming with Gothic architecture (like you'd expect), pops of vibrant red and orange details and cute little windows.

## 2. Painshill Park Grotto

I don't know why but I originally thought the <ExternalLink
cta="crystal grotto"
href="https://www.painshill.co.uk/crystal-grotto/"
/> was all natural but it's obviously not! It's really cool to see in person, unless you're not interested in wandering around crystal-walled caves?! The grotto has it's own <ExternalLink
cta="opening hours"
href="https://www.painshill.co.uk/crystal-grotto/"
/> so check times ahead of visiting, it was also the busiest place in the park but certainly not overcrowded by any means.

## 3. Fivearch Bridge

There are a few bridges surrounding the lake and Fivearch Bridge was my favourite as its completely nestled in nature.

## 4. Temple of Bacchus

The Temple of Bacchus is impressive from the outside and is currently undergoing renovation to be restored in the inside.

## 5. The Ruined Abbey

This was the last monument we visited and it was the perfect way to end a lovely day full of artistic sights! The Ruined Abbey looks great from either side of the lake so it's worth making the roundtrip.

## Painshill Park Prices<a name="prices"></a>

Entry to the park is really reasonable at £12.50 for an adult <ExternalLink
cta="ticket"

/> and £7.50 for a child ticket. Tickets can be bought when you arrive or [purchased in advance](https://shop.myonlinebooking.co.uk/Painshill/buy.aspx?tid=20) at a cheaper price if you are super organised!

## Painshill Park Opening Times<a name="hours"></a>

It can take a few hours to make your way around the entire park so don't underestimate the time you'll need there or the amount of walking required. The park is open daily from 10am - 4pm but don't get there too late as 3pm is the last time to gain entry.

Painshill Park also host a range of <ExternalLink
cta="events"
href="https://www.painshill.co.uk/events-at-painshill/"
/> so take a look and see what's on before planing a trip.
