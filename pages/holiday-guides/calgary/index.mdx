# How to Spend 2 Nights in Calgary

<PostDetails dateUpdated="Oct 2017" />

There's not a whole lot to do in Downtown Calgary, it seems to be more of a town that people pass through on their way to visit [Banff](banff) to see the Canadian Rocky mountains. I've put together a little travel guide on what to do if you're there for a day or two.

## Where to Stay in Calgary<a name="accommodation"></a>

We stayed at the <ExternalLink
cta="Fairmont Palliser Hotel"
href="https://booking.tp.st/ECtHmMaT"
/> as the room price was incredibly reasonable for such a luxury hotel chain! The location is ideal, as it's in the heart of the city and just a few minutes walk from the <ExternalLink
cta="Calgary Tower"
href="https://www.calgarytower.com/"
/> which you can probably see from your hotel room window. This hotel is grand, boasting a lavish foyer with elegant chandeliers, striking marble pillars and rich gold accents.

Our room was generous in size, especially for a standard, and to my delight it was recently refurbished. It was pretty quiet so we slept fairly well, apart from hearing the odd few trains passing through. We ordered room service a few times when suffering from jet-lag and I have to say the the food was consistently outstanding, it was pricey but well worth it! The facilities include an indoor pool, spa and a Starbucks located on the lower ground floor which was useful for water, snacks and of course hot drinks to warm us up.

## Things to Do &amp; Places to Visit<a name="things-to-do"></a>

<br />

### Olympic Plaza

We walked down to the <ExternalLink
cta="Olympic Plaza"
href="https://www.calgary.ca/parks/olympic-plaza.html"
/> on Stephen Avenue, where medals were presented in the 1988 Winter Olympics. There were no events on when we visited, but it was still a nice place for a stroll on a sunny day. The plaza is well maintained and has a water feature in the center with the Canadian Maple leaf, surrounded by fountains. Worth a pit-stop, but don't go out of your way to visit.

### Calgary Tower

We went to <ExternalLink
cta="Calgary Tower"
href="https://www.calgarytower.com/"
/> one evening for dinner and to checkout the 360-degree views of the city from the observation deck. We chose to eat at the revolving restaurant, <ExternalLink
cta="Sky 360"
href="https://www.sky360.ca/"
/> which was definitely a unique dining experience with pleasant food and excellent service. Top tip... don't leave your handbag on the window ledge, I learned the hard way that this doesn't rotate with you!

### Chinook Centre

If you fancy going shopping, catch an Uber for &dollar;15 to the <ExternalLink
cta="Chinook Centre"
href="https://shops.cadillacfairview.com/property/cf-chinook-centre"
/> which is a 15 minute drive south. It's a large shopping centre with a vast selection of fashion, beauty and homeware stores including a Nordstrom, a food court, cinema and bowling alley.

## My Top Tips<a name="tips"></a>

- Dinner with a difference - if you're thinking of booking <ExternalLink
  cta="Sky 360"
  href="https://www.sky360.ca/"
  /> for dinner, time your reservation at sunset for a spectacular view
- Wrap up warm - it was snowing in early October and was bitterly cold! Coats, scarves, gloves, hats are a must
- Time well spent - if you're heading to [Banff](banff), consider extending your stay to spend more time there and less time in Calgary

## Final Thoughts<a name="summary"></a>

We stayed in Calgary for 2 nights in October 2017, over the Canadian Thanksgiving period (second Monday in October) which may be the reason why it was tremendously quiet. That said, I wouldn't plan to stay here for an extended period of time, a weekend is fine!
