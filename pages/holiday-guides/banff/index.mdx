## Where to Stay in Banff<a name="accommodation"></a>

We had a comfortable commute to Banff on the <ExternalLink
cta="Brewster Express"
href="https://www.banffjaspercollection.com/brewster-express/"
/> from downtown [Calgary](calgary), complete with scenic mountain views. After a fairly long drive, we arrived at our hotel <ExternalLink
cta="Moose Hotel and Suites"
href="https://booking.tp.st/IoocxT7a"
/>. Moose is one of the nicest hotels I've stayed in and is the newest to <ExternalLink
cta="Banff town"
href="https://banff.ca/"
/>, built in 2016. The hotel, facilities and our suite were luxurious and had a modern kitchenette, balcony, cosy electric fire and fabulous toiletries. The amenities were excellent too, there's 2 roof-top pools, a spa, onsite restaurant and more.

We had a lovely breakfast one morning at <ExternalLink
cta="Pacini"
href="https://moosehotelandsuites.com/pacini-restaurant/"
/> the onsite restaurant, it was excellent value and featured generous portions. Each breakfast came with a fruit salad and a Duo Mattino, which is a mini slice of fruity bread and a shot of yoghurt and granola. You could also visit the bread bar for free which had a variety of breads and spreads - a great way to fuel up before heading out in the cold!

## Things to Do &amp; Places to Visit<a name="things-to-do"></a>

<br />

### Bow River Trail

I recommend spending some time walking around the cute little resort town of Banff and going on some easy walking trails, you'll be amazed at what you can see just by walking a short distance. The <ExternalLink
cta="Bow River trail"
href="https://www.banfflakelouise.com/experiences/hike-bow-river-loop"
/> is a nice, picturesque walk and leads to Bow Falls.

### Tunnel Mountain Trail

If you're after something a bit more challenging and adventurous, the <ExternalLink
cta="Tunnel Mountain trail"
href="https://www.banfflakelouise.com/experiences/tunnel-mountain-summit-trail"
/> is ideal. The elevation gain is 300 m and the roundtrip from Banff town took about 2.5 hours, mostly because it started snowing half way up. Unfortunately the snow meant we couldn't see much when we got to the top, but the experience was incredible and the trees looked dreamy covered in snow.

### Grizzly House

After a chilly day out you have to visit the cosy <ExternalLink
cta="Grizzly House"
href="https://banffgrizzlyhouse.com/"
/> in town and indulge in their delicious cheese fondue for two! This is hands down the best fondue I've ever had, it features the usual mix of Swiss cheese, wine and Kirsch, but it's not too boozy and is served with a generous basket of bread cubes. This restaurant gets very busy so I highly recommend making a reservation.

### Lake Louise Tour

<p>
  <ExternalLink
    cta="Lake Louise"
    href="https://www.banfflakelouise.com/experiences/lake-louise"
  />{" "}
  was the highlight for me, we booked a{" "}
  <ExternalLink cta="Discover Banff Tour" href="https://banfftours.com/" /> as
  we didn't have a car and it was just perfect. It snowed the day before and the
  snow settled, resulting in a stunning winter wonderland scene. It's worth
  nipping into the impressive{" "}
  <ExternalLink
    cta="Fairmont Hotel"
    href="https://www.fairmont.com/banff-springs/"
  />{" "}
  to defrost and have a nose around this swanky hotel before heading back to the
  lake. On this tour we also visited the Fairmont Banff Springs Hotel, the{" "}

  , Bow River, Bow Falls, <ExternalLink

    href="https://www.banfflakelouise.com/experiences/hoodoos-trail"

    cta="Vermillion Lakes"
    href="https://www.banfflakelouise.com/vermilion-lakes"
  /> for photos.

## My Top Tips<a name="tips"></a>

- Wrap up warm - thermals, layers, waterproofs and comfortable shoes are a must, the temperature dropped to -10°C/14°F one night
- Hiking necessities - don't be like me, pack bottles of water and energy bars... also don't bring a handbag it's a pain to carry!
- No car, no problem - we got around fine without one. There are <ExternalLink
    cta="tours"
    href="https://banfftours.com/"
    /> you can do and <ExternalLink
  cta="Roam buses"
  href="https://roamtransit.com/schedules-routes/route-1/"
  /> that can take you to places for $2
- So many lakes... so little time - <ExternalLink
  cta="Lake Louise"
  href="https://www.banfflakelouise.com/experiences/lake-louise"
  /> is an absolute must! Make it a priority to visit this beauty otherwise you'll miss out

## Final Thoughts<a name="summary"></a>

We stayed in Banff for 3 nights in October 2017 and I recommend staying for at least 5 to see everything. When I return, I'd like to visit the hot springs, take a ride on the <ExternalLink
cta="Banff gondola"
href="https://www.banffjaspercollection.com/attractions/banff-gondola/"
/> and see <ExternalLink
cta="Moraine Lake"
href="https://www.banfflakelouise.com/experiences/moraine-lake"
/>, <ExternalLink
cta="Lake Minnewanka"
href="https://www.banfflakelouise.com/experiences/lake-minnewanka"
/>, <ExternalLink
cta="Peyto Lake"
href="https://www.banfflakelouise.com/experiences/peyto-lake"
/> and <ExternalLink
cta="Jasper National Park"
href="https://www.jasper.travel/"
/>.
