### Peter Pan Afternoon Tea at AquaShard – London Bridge<a name="shard"></a>

<p>
  <ExternalLink
    cta="Peter Pan Afternoon Tea"
    href="https://aquashard.co.uk/peter-pan-afternoon-tea/"
  />{" "}
  at AquaShard offers a whimsical experience high above London, with stunning
  views that take centre stage. I visited in January on a Saturday, and as
  expected it was quite busy. Unfortunately, the service didn’t quite match the
  setting, and at one point they even forgot to bring our desserts! While this
  was disappointing, the staff were apologetic once reminded.
</p>

We opted for the Champagne Tea, priced at £90 per person. Although we weren’t seated directly by a window, we were close enough to enjoy the breathtaking London city views, so this didn’t detract from our experience. The decor itself was minimal, which makes sense as the view is clearly the highlight here.

What really stood out was the whimsical presentation of the tea. The sweet treats were displayed on a pirate ship centerpiece, complete with added smoke effects that created a magical and theatrical touch — perfect for the Peter Pan theme! However, while the presentation was impressive, the food itself was sadly average. The sandwiches and desserts were fine but lacked the wow factor you’d expect at this price. If you’re a foodie, this might not be the tea for you, as the focus leans heavily on the ambiance vs flavours.

Overall, AquaShard’s Peter Pan Afternoon Tea is worth considering if you’re after an experience with stunning views and imaginative presentation, but perhaps not if you’re looking for exceptional food.

#### Summary

- **Getting to <ExternalLink

### Festive High Palms Afternoon Tea at The Landmark – Marylebone<a name="landmark"></a>

<p>
  <ExternalLink
    cta="The Landmark"
    href="https://www.landmarklondon.co.uk/gallery/"
  />{" "}
  offers a memorable afternoon tea experience, particularly during the festive
  season. I visited in December, mid-week in the afternoon to enjoy their{" "}
  <ExternalLink
    cta="'Festive High Palms High Tea'"
    href="https://www.landmarklondon.co.uk/dining/high-palms-high-tea"
  />
  , which was priced at £102pp and included a glass of Tattinger champagne.
</p>

As it wasn't a peak time of day, the venue was pleasantly quiet, and we were seated in a prime spot facing both the live pianist and a beautifully decorated Christmas tree. The festive decor was tasteful and understated, perfectly complementing the space, which felt like a posh conservatory thanks to its tall palm trees and elegant surroundings! The live piano music added to the ambiance, though it became a bit repetitive after a couple of hours.

The service was excellent, consistent and attentive throughout our sitting. One standout feature of The Landmark’s afternoon tea was the generous offering of extra sandwiches. Staff regularly came around with platters of freshly made sandwiches, ensuring we never went without — this is something I’ve not experienced at other venues.

The food itself was delicious. The scones were served with the usual jam and clotted cream, but the addition of a salted caramel ganache was a real highlight, offering an unexpected and indulgent twist! The sandwiches were fresh and flavourful, and the festive desserts were well-executed, with the Christmas pudding-inspired dessert being my personal favourite.

Overall, The Landmark is a top choice for afternoon tea in London. Its stunning setting, impeccable service and thoughtful touches make it an experience I wouldn’t hesitate to repeat.

#### Summary

- **Getting to <ExternalLink
    cta="The Landmark"
    href="https://www.landmarklondon.co.uk/location/"

- **Price of Afternoon Tea at The Landmark** - £102 per person, including a glass of Tattinger champagne

### Traditional Afternoon Tea at The Savoy – Covent Garden<a name="savoy"></a>

<p>
  <ExternalLink
    cta="Tea at The Savoy"
    href="https://www.thesavoylondon.com/experience/afternoon-tea-london/"
  />{" "}
  is a luxurious affair, but sadly my experience in December 2024 left me
  underwhelmed. I had the Champagne Christmas Afternoon Tea, which cost £120 per
  person. While the champagne was delightful, the final bill including service
  (£276 for two), made it very difficult to justify the price!
</p>

The <ExternalLink
    cta="festive decorations"
    href="https://www.savoychristmas.com/"
  /> added charm to the venue, but the overall experience fell short of expectations. I booked the last tea seating at 5:15 pm on a Saturday, but it’s worth noting that discrepancies in afternoon tea timings on <ExternalLink
cta="OpenTable"
href="https://www.opentable.co.uk/r/savoy-lounge-london"
/> versus The Savoy’s website led to some confusion, requiring me to confirm the time after booking. Upon arrival, the check-in process felt disorganised – queuing to give your name, heading to the cloakroom, and then queuing again for your table! It took 20 minutes from arrival to being seated, despite arriving on time.

The food was a mixed experience - the sandwiches were excellent, with the egg and truffle brioche bun being the standout item. However, asking for a second serving of sandwiches felt awkward, as the staff frequently mentioned the additional servings. The desserts were the biggest letdown – they lacked a wow factor and weren’t arranged attractively on the plate. I even had to tweak them to take a decent photo!

The service was also inconsistent, with three different servers attending to us, which disrupted the flow of the experience. Additionally, being seated next to the piano, while atmospheric made it difficult to hold a conversation at a table for two.

While I’m glad I got to experience tea at The Savoy, I wouldn’t return or recommend it at this price point. Instead, I’d suggest <ExternalLink
    cta="The Landmark"
    href="https://www.landmarklondon.co.uk/dining-wellness/afternoon-tea/"
  /> or <ExternalLink
    cta="Fortnum & Mason"
    href="https://www.fortnumandmason.com/restaurants/afternoon-tea"
  /> as more enjoyable and worthwhile alternatives.

#### Summary

- **Getting to <ExternalLink
    cta="The Savoy"
    href="https://www.thesavoylondon.com/find-us/"
  /> ** - Located near Covent Garden, Embankment and Charing Cross are the closest stations
- **Price of Afternoon Tea at The Savoy** - Extremely expensive at £120 per person, with Champagne Afternoon Tea
- **The Savoy Afternoon Tea dress code** - Smart casual was fine here, I'd say to avoid overly relaxed clothing
- **Afternoon tea <ExternalLink

### Festive Afternoon Tea at The Royal Lancaster – Lancaster Gate<a name="royal-lancaster"></a>

The Festive Afternoon Tea at <ExternalLink
    cta="Royal Lancaster"
    href="https://www.royallancaster.com/bars/afternoon-tea/"
  /> offers a cosy and pleasant experience, perfect for a catch-up during the holiday season! I visited on a Saturday lunchtime in December, and although it was busy the venue’s small size gave it an intimate and private feel.

We opted for the festive tea at £64 per person, adding a glass of champagne for an additional £15. We were seated in a little nook, which was a lovely touch — it gave us a great spot to observe the room while still enjoying a private chat. The decor was festive, as you’d expect during the season, and the journey to the table felt exciting, with impressive decorations both outside and in the foyer of the hotel.

The service was excellent, with friendly and attentive staff who made us feel welcome throughout. As for the food, it was nice, though not particularly memorable. However, given the lower price point compared to some of London’s more extravagant afternoon teas, it offered good value for money.

If you’re looking for a festive tea with lovely service and a cosy atmosphere, Royal Lancaster is a great choice, especially if you’re mindful of budget.

#### Summary

- **Getting to <ExternalLink
    cta="Royal Lancaster"
    href="https://www.royallancaster.com"
  />** - Lancaster Gate station is just a short walk away
- **Price of Afternoon Tea at Royal Lancaster** - £64 per person, with options to add a glass of champagne
- **Royal Lancaster Afternoon Tea dress code** - casual is totally fine here
- **Afternoon tea <ExternalLink
    cta="menu"
    href="https://www.royallancaster.com/bars/afternoon-tea/"
  />** - A festive selection of sandwiches, scones, and desserts, offering good value for a London tea

### Festive Afternoon Tea at The Corinthia Crystal Moon Lounge – Embankment<a name="corinthia"></a>

I’ve had the Festive Afternoon Tea at <ExternalLink
    cta="The Corinthia’s Crystal Moon Lounge"
    href="https://www.corinthia.com/en-gb/london/restaurants-bars/afternoon-tea"
  /> twice now, and while it’s undeniably a beautiful experience, I decided not to return last year because of the price. At a whopping £95 per person, by the time you add service, it just doesn’t feel like great value - especially during the busy Christmas period!

The hotel itself is exquisite, which you’d expect from a 5-star venue, and it’s always decorated beautifully for the season. The Crystal Moon Lounge is a grand space that can accommodate a lot of guests, which does slightly detract from the intimacy you might expect from an afternoon tea experience.

The service is consistently great, attentive and professional—but I would recommend not arriving early, as they’ll likely ask you to come back closer to your booking time. The food is good overall, but while the desserts look stunning, they don’t quite live up to their appearance in terms of taste.

If you’re looking for a lovely setting to enjoy tea, this is certainly a nice choice, but I’d suggest going during the normal afternoon tea period rather than Christmas. The experience is still beautiful, and the pricing is more reasonable outside of the festive season.

#### Summary

- **Getting there:** <ExternalLink
    cta="The hotel"
    href="https://www.corinthia.com/en-gb/london"
  /> is near Embankment and Charing Cross stations
- **Price:** £95 per person during the festive season
- **Best time:** Skip Christmas and visit during the regular afternoon tea period for better value
- **Highlights:** Stunning 5-star setting, beautiful seasonal decor and consistently great service
- **Considerations:** Expensive for what you get, especially during Christmas, and desserts don’t taste as good as they look

### Christmas Afternoon Tea Bus Tour by BB Bakery – London<a name="bb-bakery"></a>

The <ExternalLink
    cta="BB Bakery Christmas Afternoon Tea Sightseeing Bus Tour"
    href="https://b-bakery.com/london/bus-tours/christmas-afternoon-tea"
  /> is one of my absolute favourite afternoon tea experiences—not because of the food, but because of the entire experience! I booked front window seats on the upper deck for £74 per person, which gave us unreal views of the Christmas lights in London.

One important tip: make sure you book your tea for when it will be dark so you can fully enjoy the magical nighttime lights. I went in December on a Saturday lunchtime, and I was so excited when the classic Routemaster bus pulled up—it was the perfect start to the festive outing.

The experience itself was as fun as it was unique. As you sip on your hot tea or mulled wine, you’ll need to carefully navigate the occasional jerky stops and starts of London traffic! The food was nice, with a surprising first course of savoury snacks before the sandwiches, which was a lovely touch. We couldn’t finish all the sweets, so we packed them up to enjoy later at home.

This is such a wonderful way to take in the Christmas lights and see parts of London, all while enjoying a festive tea. We had so many laughs during the journey with the motion of the bus and trying to eat and drink—it was an experience like no other! The service was very friendly and added to the warm and festive atmosphere.

I’d love to do this again in the future—it’s such a fun and memorable experience.

#### Summary

- **Getting there:** <ExternalLink

### Traditional Afternoon Tea at Fortnum & Mason – Mayfair<a name="fortnum-and-mason"></a>

Afternoon tea takes place in the <ExternalLink
    cta="Diamond Jubilee Tea Salon"
    href="https://www.fortnumandmason.com/diamond-jubilee-tea-salon"
  />, which is on the top floor of this <ExternalLink
    cta="famous department store"
    href="https://www.fortnumandmason.com/"
  />. The tea salon is just lovely and is the perfect setting to enjoy a luxurious tea, featuring exquisite food and outstanding 5-star service.

We were given a special selection of teas and the usual finger sandwiches which I really enjoyed but the sweet treats are really the showstoppers here. The scones were delicious and served with lemon curd, clotted cream and strawberry jam, and the top tier of the cake stand featured rich, flawless looking pastries. The tea salon has a calm atmosphere, with live music being played on the grand piano - you can easily forget you're dining in a busy department store in the heart of London! At the end of our tea, our waiter very kindly packed up our lemon curd, jam, leftover pastries and offered us slices of cakes that we were too full to try so we could enjoy these at home!

The <ExternalLink
cta="Fortnum &amp; Mason"
href="https://www.fortnumandmason.com/restaurants/afternoon-tea"
/> tea is £82 per person and is more laid back than tea at <ExternalLink
cta="The Ritz"

/> or <ExternalLink
cta="The Dorchester"
href="https://www.dorchestercollection.com/en/london/the-dorchester/restaurants-bars/afternoon-tea/"
/>, especially as you don't have to be suited and booted here! The service is top notch and the setting is beautiful, making it the perfect choice for all occasions.

#### Summary

- **Getting to <ExternalLink
  cta="Fortnum &amp; Mason"
  href="https://www.fortnumandmason.com/stores/piccadilly"

- **Price of Afternoon Tea At Fortnum &amp; Mason** - on the expensive side at £82 per person
- **Fortnum &amp; Mason Tea dress code** - smart causal, decent jeans and black trainers were fine
- **Afternoon tea <ExternalLink cta="menu" href="https://www.fortnumandmason.com/restaurants/afternoon-tea" />** - traditional; expect delicate finger sandwiches, scones and cakes

### Traditional Afternoon Tea at The Ritz – Mayfair<a name="the-ritz"></a>

<p>
  <ExternalLink cta="The Ritz" href="https://www.theritzlondon.com/" /> oozes
  elegance; when you first enter the hotel and walk into The Palm Court you
  can't help but take note of the striking floral arrangements and fancy
  chandeliers which perfectly complement this hotels Renaissance decor. You get
  the usual line up of little sandwiches which were delicious and moreish, we
  easily made our way through two plates of these. Both scones and cakes not
  only looked exceptional, they were light and tasty and we were fortunate to be
  offered a second helping of everything on the cake stand. The service was
  great, a bit fussy at times but overall it was a lovely, memorable dining
  experience! Afternoon tea at{" "}

  is priced at £79 per person and is an ideal venue for celebrating special
  occasions. If you choose to dine here, you'll have to adhere to a dress code,
  even for afternoon tea - so no jeans allowed and men must wear a jacket and a
  tie.
</p>

#### Summary

- **Getting to <ExternalLink

### Traditional Afternoon Tea at The Capital Hotel – Knightsbridge<a name="capital-hotel"></a>

<p>
  <ExternalLink
    cta="The Capital Hotel"
    href="https://www.warwickhotels.com/the-capital"
  />{" "}
  is located next to the world famous department store Harrods so you would
  expect to be paying a premium price to have tea there but in actual fact it's
  very affordable at only £59pp! It's tucked away nicely on a{" "}
  <ExternalLink
    cta="quiet side
  street"
    href="https://www.warwickhotels.com/the-capital/contact-and-location"
  />
  , so you can escape the busy surroundings and refuel - ideal if you've been shopping
  or sightseeing in Central London.
</p>

I was pleasantly surprised by both the quality of food and level of service from the <ExternalLink
    cta="The Capital Hotel"
    href="https://www.warwickhotels.com/the-capital/dining/Classic-Afternoon-Tea"
  />. When you enter the hotel you are greeted with smiles and taken to the tranquil Sitting Room where afternoon tea is served. The tea begins with some of the most delicious mini cheese scones I've ever tasted! Following this, we received our cake stand complete with a nice selection of sandwiches, warm scones and an array of impressive looking desserts. Our teas were also regularly topped up by the friendly, observant waiters so I wouldn't hesitate to return there again.

#### Summary

- **Getting to <ExternalLink
    cta="The Capital Hotel"
    href="https://www.warwickhotels.com/the-capital/contact-and-location"
  />** - located right next to Harrods, Knightsbridge is the nearest tube station

### Beauty and The Beast Themed Afternoon Tea at Town House – Kensington<a name="townhouse-kensington"></a>

After months of trying, I finally managed to get a booking at this extremely popular tea! Being themed around my favourite childhood Disney film, I had high hopes for the menu and was interested in seeing their execution. Upon arrival my first thoughts were that the <ExternalLink
    cta="Town House"
    href="https://townhousekensington.com/"
  /> is beautiful, with tasteful decor and a cosy room featuring familiar faces; Lumière and Cogsworth.

The afternoon tea includes a first course of savoury foods - I won't ruin it and go into too much detail but it's a nice way to kick things off. The presentation of the table and food is brilliant, a lot of effort and planning has gone into the menu and it pays off. You do get very full eating a savoury course before the sandwiches and cakes, but it's very good value. The service was spot on and the waiter took time to explain each food item to us in detail. Surprisingly, there were no scones - super strange for an afternoon tea! Overall, this whimsical tea is a must for Beauty and The Beast fans and features some extra surprises which I still won't reveal.

The Tale As Old As Time Tea at <ExternalLink
    cta="Town House at The Kensington"
    href="https://townhousekensington.com/afternoon-tea"
  /> is £58 per person and is ideal for Disney enthusiasts of all ages.

#### Summary

- **Getting to <ExternalLink
    cta="Town House at The Kensington"
    href="https://townhousekensington.com/contact-us-2/"
  /> ** - Gloucester Road and South Kensington tube stations are the closest
- **Price of Afternoon Tea At Town House** - reasonably priced at £58 per person
- **Town House at The Kensington dress code** - casual dress is fine but don't turn up in jogging bottoms and flip flops!
- **Afternoon tea <ExternalLink
    cta="menu"
    href="https://townhousekensington.com/afternoon-tea/"
  /> ** - a twist on traditional; mini quiches or pies before sandwiches and the possibility of no scones

## My Top Tips<a name="tips"></a>

- **Book the Last Seating**: If you’re anything like me and appreciate a little extra indulgence, aim for the last seating of the day (usually around 7pm). Venues use this time to bring out the leftovers or extra treats they’ve prepared, meaning you’re more likely to be offered additional sandwiches or cakes. It’s the ultimate win for anyone with a sweet tooth or an appetite for savoury delights!

- **Don’t Be Shy – Just Ask**: Afternoon tea is as much about the experience as it is about the food, so don’t hesitate to ask for a second (or even third!) round of your favourite sandwiches. Most places are happy to accommodate... after all, you’re paying a pretty penny for the experience, so don’t leave feeling hungry or like you’ve missed out.

- **Go During Christmas for Extra Magic**: There’s something extra special about afternoon tea during the festive season. Many venues go all out with their Christmas decorations and menus, adding that extra touch to your visit. Think gingerbread-inspired desserts, festive teas, and dining rooms adorned with twinkling fairy lights.

- **Dress for the Occasion**: While not every venue demands formal attire, a smart-casual outfit never goes amiss. Some places, like The Ritz, do enforce a dress code (sadly jackets and ties for men!), but even in more relaxed spots, dressing up a little can make the experience feel extra special.

- **Savour the Experience**: Afternoon tea is about slowing down and enjoying every bite, sip, and moment. Resist the urge to rush through the courses (as tempting as those cakes might look!) and take the time to soak in the atmosphere, the service, and the company. Make sure to pack up any leftovers so you can also enjoy them at home!

- **Plan Ahead**: Many of the top spots require booking weeks, sometimes months, in advance—especially for themed teas or festive ones. If you have your heart set on a specific venue, plan ahead to avoid disappointment.
