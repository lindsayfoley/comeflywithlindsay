# A Long Weekend in Seville, Spain: Highlights and Tips

<PostDetails dateUpdated="Jan 2025" />

Seville, the vibrant capital of Andalusia in southern Spain, is a city that perfectly combines rich history, stunning architecture, and a laid-back atmosphere. Adorned with beautiful orange trees lining its streets, Seville offers a unique and charming sight, especially for those not accustomed to seeing citrus trees everywhere!

We spent a few days here in January and were charmed by its beauty and warmth, even in the winter months. Here's everything you need to know for your trip to Seville.

## Getting to Seville<a name="getting-there"></a>

We flew from London Gatwick to Seville, with the flight taking just 2 hours and 45 minutes. Landing at 7:30 p.m., we were pleased by how straightforward it was to get to our hotel. Seville has Uber, making it simple to book a ride upon arrival, and we reached our hotel in just 25 minutes.

## Where to Stay in Seville<a name="accommodation"></a>

We stayed at the <ExternalLink
cta="Querencia de Sevilla, Autograph Collection"
href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/es/querencia-de-sevilla-autograph-collection.en-gb.html"
/>, a beautiful four-star hotel located in the heart of the city.

The check-in experience was exceptional, with a warm welcome from the staff and a delightful local sherry offered as a welcome drink. I'm not a sherry fan but this one was delicious, it was sweet, nutty, and caramel-like — and we spent the rest of the trip trying (unsuccessfully!) to find it in bars and shops across Seville.

The deluxe room was modern and spacious, featuring a comfortable queen bed, a seating area, a sleek wardrobe, and a luxurious bathroom with both a shower and bathtub. The thoughtful touch of robes and slippers made it even more comfortable. As it was my boyfriend's birthday, the hotel kindly left some gifts in the room, which was a lovely surprise.

Breakfast at the hotel was a highlight and the buffet offered a fantastic variety including fruits, meats, cheeses, pastries and breads. You could also order one hot dish from the menu too. On our last night, we dined at the hotel restaurant <ExternalLink
cta="La Maestria"
href="https://www.marriott.com/en-us/dining/restaurant-bar/svqas-querencia-de-sevilla-autograph-collection/6673530-la-maestr-a.mi"
/> and enjoyed an intimate three-course meal, as we were the only diners that evening!

## Things to Do in Seville<a name="things-to-do"></a>

<br />

### Seville Cathedral

Just a short walk from the hotel, the iconic <ExternalLink
cta="Seville Cathedral"
href="https://www.catedraldesevilla.es/"
/> is a must-see. We didn’t take the full tour but admired its stunning grandeur from the outside and explored the free-access areas inside. To make the most of your visit, secure your tickets in advance.

### Royal Alcázar of Seville

Sadly, we missed out on visiting <ExternalLink
cta="Royal Alcázar"
href="https://www.alcazarsevilla.org/"
/>, as tickets were sold out by the time we arrived. This is your reminder of to plan ahead! As a UNESCO World Heritage site with breathtaking architecture and stunning gardens, it’s definitely one to prioritise for your trip.

### Plaza de España

<p>
  <ExternalLink
    cta="Plaza de España"
    href="https://www.andalucia.com/cities/seville/plazadeespana.htm"
  />{" "}
  is one of the most beautiful places in Seville, located about a 20-minute walk
  from our hotel. This grand square features colourful tilework, mini bridges,
  and sweeping views from its elevated platforms. Best of all, it's free to
  visit!
</p>

### Triana Neighbourhood

We crossed <ExternalLink
cta="Triana Bridge"
href="https://www.andalucia.com/cities/seville/triana.htm"
/> to explore the Triana neighbourhood. The colourful buildings along the riverbank were picturesque, but we found the area itself a bit underwhelming. There’s a small market near the river where we enjoyed sangria and ham sandwich—perfect for a quick pit stop! If you visit on a Sunday, note that opening hours are limited, and many places inside may be closed.

## Favourite Restaurants in Seville<a name="dining"></a>

<br />

### **La Cochera del Abuelo**

This was hands-down our standout meal in Seville and was very hard to get a booking! While the exterior looked understated, the food and service at <ExternalLink
cta="La Cochera del Abuelo"
href="https://www.instagram.com/lacocheradelabuelo/"
/> were exceptional. Highlights included a rich bean stew, warm bread with beef butter, and their award-winning Basque-style cheesecake. If you’re a foodie, this place is a must-visit!

### **Az-Zait**

This <ExternalLink
cta="restaurant"
href="https://azzait.eatbu.com/?lang=en#menu"
/> is featured in the Michelin guide, and it was a great choice for dinner. The dishes had a creative twist, and everything we tried was enjoyable. I only wish I had room for the cheeseboard, which looked amazing!

### **La Tarte de la Madre de Cris**

After trying the basque style cheesecake from La Cochera del Abuelo, we were keen to find another contender - and we discovered it at <ExternalLink
  cta="La Tarte de la Madre de Cris"
  href="https://www.latartadelamadredecris.com/"
/>! Their cheesecake was absolutely dreamy, smooth and perfectly baked. Whether you
enjoy it as a dessert after a meal or as a mid-day treat, it’s a must-try indulgence
while in the city.

## Top Tips<a name="tips"></a>

- **Book attractions in advance**: Popular spots like the <ExternalLink
  cta="Royal Alcázar"
  href="https://alcazarsevilla.org/"
  /> sell out quickly and have extremely long queues
- **Plan for Sundays**: Many places have limited opening hours or are closed altogether, it can be like a ghost town!
- **Pack layers**: January evenings can get chilly, even if the days are mild so pack accordingly

## Final Thoughts<a name="summary"></a>

Seville is a great destination for a long weekend and while it’s not the largest city, it’s packed with charm, history, and delicious food. I'd love to return someday to explore even more of its hidden gems—and next time, we’ll be sure to book those <ExternalLink
cta="Royal Alcázar"
href="https://alcazarsevilla.org/"
/> tickets!
